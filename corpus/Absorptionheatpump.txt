absorption heat pump is essentially an air-source heat pump driven not by electricity but by a heat source such as solar-heated water or geothermal-heated water there are also absorption coolers available that work on the same principle but are not reversible and cannot serve as a heat source


single double or triple iterative absorption cooling cycles are used in different solar-thermal-cooling system designs the more cycles the more efficient they are
in the late 19th century the most common phase change refrigerant material for absorption cooling was a solution of ammonia and water today the combination of lithium bromide and water is also in common use one end of the system of expansioncondensation pipes is heated and the other end gets cold enough to make ice originally natural gas was used as a heat source in the late 19th century today propane is used in recreational vehicle absorption chiller refrigerators innovative hot water solar thermal energy collectors can also be used as the modern free energy heat source
efficient absorption chillers require water of at least 190 °f 88 °c common inexpensive flat-plate solar thermal collectors only produce about 160 °f 70 °c water but several successful commercial projects in the us asia and europe have shown that flat plate solar collectors specially developed for temperatures over 200 °f featuring double glazing increased backside insulation etc can be effective and cost efficient evacuated-tube solar panels can be used as well concentrating solar collectors required for absorption chillers are less effective in hot humid cloudy environments especially where the overnight low temperature and relative humidity are uncomfortably high where water can be heated well above 190 °f 88+ °c it can be stored and used when the sun is not shining
for 150 years absorption chillers have been used to make ice before the electric light bulb was invented this ice can be stored and used as an ice battery for cooling when the sun is not shining as it was in the 1995 hotel new otani tokyo in japan mathematical models are available in the public domain for ice-based thermal energy storage performance calculations
by using a fuel cell as opposed to a burner to create heat it would be theoretically possible to create an air-conditioner which converted approximately 55% of the fuel assuming a methane fuel cell to electricity and the rest to driving an air-conditionercitation needed
