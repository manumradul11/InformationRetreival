aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel in which the liquid component of the gel has been replaced with a gas the result is a solid with extremely low density and low thermal conductivity nicknames include frozen smoke solid smoke solid air or blue smoke owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material it feels like fragile expanded polystyrene to the touch aerogels can be made from a variety of chemical compounds
aerogel was first created by samuel stephens kistler in 1931 as a result of a betcitation needed with charles learned over who could replace the liquid in jellies with gas without causing shrinkage
aerogels are produced by extracting the liquid component of a gel through supercritical drying this allows the liquid to be slowly dried off without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from capillary action as would happen with conventional evaporation the first aerogels were produced from silica gels kistler's later work involved aerogels based on alumina chromia and tin dioxide carbon aerogels were first developed in the late 1980scitation needed
aerogel does not have a designated material with set chemical formula but the term is used to group all the material with a certain geometric structure


despite their name aerogels are solid rigid and dry materials that do not resemble a gel in their physical properties the name comes from the fact that they are made from gels pressing softly on an aerogel typically does not leave even a minor mark pressing more firmly will leave a permanent depression pressing extremely firmly will cause a catastrophic breakdown in the sparse structure causing it to shatter like glass – a property known as friability although more modern variations do not suffer from this despite the fact that it is prone to shattering it is very strong structurally its impressive load bearing abilities are due to the dendritic microstructure in which spherical particles of average size 2–5 nm are fused together into clusters these clusters form a three-dimensional highly porous structure of almost fractal chains with pores just under 100 nm the average size and density of the pores can be controlled during the manufacturing process
aerogel is a material that is 98.2% air the lack of solid material allows aerogel to be almost weightless the reason for the difference in the composition is the structure of the aerogel aerogel has a porous solid network that contains air pockets with the air pockets taking up majority of space within the material
aerogels are good thermal insulators because they almost nullify two of the three methods of heat transfer convection conduction and radiation they are good conductive insulators because they are composed almost entirely of gas and gases are very poor heat conductors silica aerogel is especially good because silica is also a poor conductor of heat a metallic aerogel on the other hand would be less effective they are good convective inhibitors because air cannot circulate through the lattice aerogels are poor radiative insulators because infrared radiation which transfers heat passes through them
owing to its hygroscopic nature aerogel feels dry and acts as a strong desiccant people handling aerogel for extended periods should wear gloves to prevent the appearance of dry brittle spots on their skin
the slight color it does have is due to rayleigh scattering of the shorter wavelengths of visible light by the nano-sized dendritic structure this causes it to appear smoky blue against dark backgrounds and yellowish against bright backgrounds
aerogel is an open porous network the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that an open porous network allows gases to enter and leave the substance without any limitation while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material 
aerogels by themselves are hydrophilic but chemical treatment can make them hydrophobic if they absorb moisture they usually suffer a structural change such as contraction and deteriorate but degradation can be prevented by making them hydrophobic aerogels with hydrophobic interiors are less susceptible to degradation than aerogels with only an outer hydrophobic layer even if a crack penetrates the surface hydrophobic treatment facilitates processing because it allows the use of a water jet cutter
aerogels may have a thermal conductivity smaller than the gas they contain this is caused by the knudsen effect knudsen effect is the reduction of thermal conductivity in gases when the size of the cavity encompassing the gas becomes comparable to the mean free path effectively the cavity restricts the movement of the gas particles decreasing the thermal conductivity in addition to eliminating convection for example thermal conductivity of air is about 25 mwm·k at stp and in a large container but decreases to about 5 mwm·k in a pore 30 nanometers in diameter
aerogel structure is the result from a sol-gel polymerization which is when monomers simple molecules reacts with other monomers to form a sol or a substance that consists of bonded cross-linked macromolecules with deposits of liquid solution between them when the material is critically heated the liquid is evaporated out and the bonded cross-linked macromolecule frame is left behind the result of the polymerization and critical heating is the creation of a material that has a porous strong structure classified as aerogel
aerogel contains particles that are 2-5 nm in diameter after the process of creating aerogel it will contain a large amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface the hydroxyl groups can cause a strong reaction when placing it in water the aerogel will catastrophically dissolve in the water one way to waterproof the hydrophilic aerogel is by soaking the aerogel with some chemical base that will replace hydroxyl groups with non-polar groups on the surface the non-polar groups -or is most effective when r is an aliphatic group 
there are several ways to determine the porosity of aerogel the three main methods are gas adsorption mercury porosimetry and scattering method in gas adsorption nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample the gas being adsorbed is dependent on the size of the pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its saturation pressure measure the volume of the gas adsorbed by using the brunauer emmit and teller formula bet gives the specific surface area of the sample at high partial pressure in the adsorptiondesorption the kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample in mercury porosimetry the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores size but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force the scattering methods involves the angle dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample the sample can be solid particles or pores the radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network the best radiation wavelengths to use are x-rays and neutrons aerogel is also an open porous network the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network gasses can enter and leave the substance without any limitation while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing it to stay within the pores 
silica aerogel is the most common type of aerogel and the most extensively studied and used it is silica-based derived from silica gel the lowest-density silica nanofoam weighs 1000 gm3 which is the evacuated version of the record-aerogel of 1900 gm3 the density of air is 1200 gm3 at 20 °c and 1 atm as of 2013update aerographene had a lower density at 160 gm3 or 13%  the density of air at room temperature
the silica solidifies into three-dimensional intertwined clusters that comprise only 3% of the volume conduction through the solid is therefore very low the remaining 97% of the volume is composed of air in extremely small nanopores the air has little room to move inhibiting both convection and gas-phase conduction
it has remarkable thermal insulative properties having an extremely low thermal conductivity from 0.03 wm·k in atmospheric pressure down to 0.004 wm·k in modest vacuum which correspond to r-values of 14 to 105 us customary or 3.0 to 22.2 metric for 3.5 in 89 mm thickness for comparison typical wall insulation is 13 us customary or 2.7 metric for the same thickness its melting point is 1473 k 1200 °c 2192 °f
until 2011 silica aerogel held 15 entries in guinness world records for material properties including best insulator and lowest-density solid though it was ousted from the latter title by the even lighter materials aerographite in 2012 and then aerographene in 2013
carbon aerogels are composed of particles with sizes in the nanometer range covalently bonded together they have very high porosity over 50% with pore diameter under 100 nm and surface areas ranging between 400–1000 m2g they are often manufactured as composite paper non-woven paper made of carbon fibers impregnated with resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel and pyrolyzed depending on the density carbon aerogels may be electrically conductive making composite aerogel paper useful for electrodes in capacitors or deionization electrodes due to their extremely high surface area carbon aerogels are used to create supercapacitors with values ranging up to thousands of farads based on a capacitance density of 104 fg and 77 fcm3 carbon aerogels are also extremely black in the infrared spectrum reflecting only 0.3% of radiation between 250 nm and 14.3 µm making them efficient for solar energy collectors
the term aerogel to describe airy masses of carbon nanotubes produced through certain chemical vapor deposition techniques is incorrect such materials can be spun into fibers with strength greater than kevlar and unique electrical properties these materials are not aerogels however since they do not have a monolithic internal structure and do not have the regular pore structure characteristic of aerogels
metal oxide aerogels are used as catalysts in various chemical reactionstransformations or as precursors for other materials
aerogels made with aluminium oxide are known as alumina aerogels these aerogels are used as catalysts especially when doped with a metal other than aluminium nickel–alumina aerogel is the most common combination alumina aerogels are also being considered by nasa for capturing hypervelocity particles a formulation doped with gadolinium and terbium could fluoresce at the particle impact site with the amount of fluorescence dependent on impact energy
one of the most notable difference between silica aerogels and metal oxide aerogel is that metal oxide aerogels are often variedly colored

organic polymers can be used to create aerogels seagel is made of agar cellulose from plants can be used to create a flexible aerogel
chalcogel is an aerogel made of chalcogens the column of elements on the periodic table beginning with oxygen such as sulfur selenium and other elements metals less expensive than platinum have been used in its creation
aerogels made of cadmium selenide quantum dots in a porous 3-d network have been developed for use in the semiconductor industry
aerogel performance may be augmented for a specific application by the addition of dopants reinforcing structures and hybridizing compounds aspen aerogels makes products such as spaceloft which are composites of aerogel with some kind of fibrous batting
aerogels are used for a variety of applications
production of aerogels is done by the sol-gel process first a gel is created in solution and then the liquid is carefully removed to leave the aerogel intact
the first step is the creation of a colloidal suspension of solid particles known as a sol silica aerogel is made by the creation of colloidal silica the process starts with a liquid alcohol such as ethanol which is mixed with a silicon alkoxide precursor for example tetramethyl orthosilicate tmos or tetraethyl orthosilicate teos a hydrolysis reaction forms particles of silicon dioxide forming a sol solution the oxide suspension begins to undergo condensation reactions which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges either m–o–m oxo bridges or m–oh–m ol bridges linking the dispersed colloidal particles
when this interlinking has stopped the flow of liquid within the material this is known as a gel this process is known as gelation these reactions generally have moderately slow reaction rates and as a result either acidic or basic catalysts are used to improve the processing speed basic catalysts tend to produce more transparent aerogels with less shrinkage
the removal of the liquid from a true aerogel involves special processing gels where the liquid is allowed to evaporate normally are known as xerogels as the liquid evaporates forces caused by surface tensions of the liquid-solid interfaces are enough to destroy the fragile gel network as a result xerogels cannot achieve the high porosities and instead peak at lower porosities and exhibit large amounts of shrinkage after drying
in 1931 to develop the first aerogels kistler used a process known as supercritical drying by increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a supercritical fluid state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network while this can be done with ethanol the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions a safer lower temperature and pressure method involves a solvent exchange this is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a co2 miscible liquid such as ethanol or acetone then onto liquid carbon dioxide and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its critical point a variant on this process involves the direct injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel the end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume
aerogel composites have been made using a variety of continuous and discontinuous reinforcements the high aspect ratio of fibers such as fiberglass have been used to reinforce aerogel composites with significantly improved mechanical properties
resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel rf aerogel is made in a way similar to production of silica aerogel
carbon aerogel is made from a resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel by its pyrolysis in inert gas atmosphere leaving a matrix of carbon it is commercially available as solid shapes powders or composite paper
silica-based aerogels are not known to be carcinogenic or toxic however they are a mechanical irritant to the eyes skin respiratory tract and digestive system small silica particles can potentially cause silicosis when inhaled they can also induce dryness of the skin eyes and mucous membranes therefore it is recommended that protective gear including respiratory protection gloves and eye goggles be worn whenever handling aerogels
