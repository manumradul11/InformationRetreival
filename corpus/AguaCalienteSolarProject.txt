the agua caliente solar project is a 290 megawatt mw photovoltaic power station built in yuma county arizona using thin-film technology based cdte pv panels manufactured by first solar the project was completed in april 2014


39 mw was online as of december 2011 and 100 mw was completed as of april 2012 200 mw was completed as of july 2012 and 247 mw in august 2012 when the 10th section was completed the addition of more panels has halted until 2013 with crates of panels covered to protect them
in august 2011 the department of energy finalized a $967 million loan guarantee for the project the project sponsor nrg solar estimates the photovoltaic generation facility will fund approximately 400 construction jobs and 16 full-time operating jobs and will be one of the largest plants of its kind in the world when completed the power produced will be sold to pg&e pacific gas & electric in california in a 25 year power purchase agreement
the series 3 thin film panels use cdscdte and are rated from 77 watts to 82.5 watts each and are mounted at a fixed tilt angle 20940 are connected in each array rated at 1.26 mwac and over 400 sma 720cp inverters are used two inverters are connected to each array
in february 2012 agua caliente competed in the excellence in renewable energy awards and won project of the year award
