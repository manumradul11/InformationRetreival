alta wind energy center awec also known as mojave wind farm is the second largest onshore wind energy project in the worldthe alta wind energy center is a wind farm located in tehachapi pass of the tehachapi mountains in kern county california as of 2013 it is the largest wind farm in the united states with a combined installed capacity of 1547 mw 2075000 hp the project being developed near tehachapi pass wind farm— site of the first large-scale wind farms installed in the us in the 1970s and 1980s—is a powerful illustration of the growing size and scope of modern wind projects
southern california edison has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement for the power produced as part of the power purchase agreements for up to 1500 mw 2000000 hp or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the tehachapi area the project will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 5.2 million metric tons which is equivalent to taking 446000 cars off the road a total of 3000 mw 4000000 hp is planned
the wind farm is being developed by terra-gen power which closed a us$1.2 billion financing deal in july 2010 with partners that included citibank barclays capital and credit suisse after many delays the first phase began construction in 2010 financing for additional phases of $650 million was secured in april 2012 construction of the alta wind energy center is expected to create more than 3000 domestic manufacturing construction and maintenance jobs and contribute more than one billion dollars to the local economy


the original alta-oak creek mojave project plan consisted of up to 320 wind turbines occupying a 9000-acre 36 km2 area while producing 800 mw 1100000 hp of power that project was originally developed by oak creek energy systems under the contract with terra-gen but the project development was later transferred to terra-gen the project then became the first development under the umbrella of alta wind energy center
the alta-oak creek mojave project is generally located at the south side of the oak creek road starting a few miles west of the state route 14 in mojave and continuing westward along the oak creek road to the west side of the tehachapi-willow springs road
according to the american wind energy association two initial projects were completed in fall 2010 the 150 mw 200000 hp alta ii vestas project using 50 3 mw 4000 hp generators and the 150 mw alta i project using 100 1.5 mw generators three subsequent projects 150 mw alta iii 102 mw 137000 hp alta iv and 168 mw alta v projects were completed in the 2nd quarter of 2011 using 50 34 and 56 3 mw vestas v-90 wind turbines alta viii and alta vi projects comprising 300 mw 400000 hp were completed in late 2011early 2012 alta vii and ix projects comprising 300 mw 400000 hp were completed in december 2012 bringing the total to 1320 mw 1770000 hp but they were renamed to pinyon pines wind i and pinyon pines wind ii
138 mw 185000 hp alta x and 90 mw 120000 hp alta xi are under development with scheduled completion in late 2013 180 mw 240000 hp alta xiii in 2019
