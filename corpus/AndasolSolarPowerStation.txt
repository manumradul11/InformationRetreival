the andasol solar power station is a 150-megawatt mw concentrated solar power station and europe's first commercial plant to use parabolic troughs it is located near guadix in andalusia spain and its name is a portmanteau of andalusia and sol sun in spanish the andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt as thermal energy storage to continue generating electricity irrespective of whether the sun is shining or not


andasol is the first parabolic trough power plant in europe and andasol 1 went online in march 2009 because of the high altitude 1100 m and the semi-arid climate the site has exceptionally high annual direct insolation of 2200 kwhm² per year each plant has a gross electricity output of 50 megawatts mwe producing around 165 gigawatt-hours gw·h per year the collectors installed have a combined surface area of 51 hectares equal to 70 soccer fields it occupies about 200 ha of land
andasol has a thermal storage system which absorbs part of the heat produced in the solar field during the day this heat is then stored in a molten salt mixture of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate a turbine produces electricity using this heat during the evening or when the sky is overcast this process almost doubles the number of operational hours at the solar thermal power plant per year a fully loaded storage system holds 1010 mw·h of heat enough to run the turbine for about 7.5 hours at full-load in case it rains or after sunset the heat reservoirs each consist of two tanks measuring 14 m in height and 36 m in diameter and containing molten salt andasol 1 is able to supply environmentally friendly solar electricity for up to 200000 people
andasol consists of 3 projects andasol-1 completed 2008 andasol-2 completed 2009 and andasol-3 completed 2011 each project generates approximately 165 gw-h each per year a total of 495 gw-h for all three combined the total cost of building the three projects was estimated to €900 million
andasol 1 cost around €300 million us$380 million to build thermal energy storage costs roughly us$50 per kwh of capacity 150 lbs of salt per kwh at a storage temperature of 400 °c according to greg glatzmaier of the us national renewable energy laboratory nrel totaling about 13% of andasol's initial cost
the developers say andasol's electricity will cost €0.271 per kilowatt-hour kw·h to produce under current government policy in spain solar-thermal electricity will receive a feed-in tariff of just under €0.27kw·h for the next 25 years
like every power plant with a thermal engine cooling is needed for the working fluid as andasol is built in the warm middle of the south of spain every andasol unit vaporizes 870.000 m³ water per year according to the developer or 5 lkwh 1.3 usgalkwh most power plants vaporize less water typically less than 2.5 lkwh or close to none if they are cooled by river or sea water although water supply is generally a problem in spain andasol has ample supply due to its location near sierra nevada
the developer of the andasol 1 and andasol 2 plants are solar millennium 25% and acs cobra 75% after planning engineering and construction solar millennium sold their shares to acs group andasol 3 is developed by the consortium of solar millennium and man ferrostaal marquesado solar sl is the investor consortium which is going to commission and operate andasol 3 shareholders of marquesado solar sl are
