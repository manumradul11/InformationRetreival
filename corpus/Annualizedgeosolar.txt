annualized geo-solar enables passive solar heating in even cold foggy north temperate areas it uses the ground under or around a building as thermal mass to heat and cool the building after a designed conductive thermal lag of 6 months the heat is returned to or removed from the inhabited spaces of the building in hot climates exposing the collector to the frigid night sky in winter can cool the building in summer
the six-month thermal lag is provided by about three meters ten feet of dirt a six-meter-wide 20Â ft buried skirt of insulation around the building keeps rain and snow melt out of the dirt which is usually under the building the dirt does radiant heating and cooling through the floor or walls a thermal siphon moves the heat between the dirt and the solar collector the solar collector may be a sheet-metal compartment in the roof or a wide flat box on the side of a building or hill the siphons may be made from plastic pipe and carry air using air prevents water leaks and water-caused corrosion plastic pipe doesn't corrode in damp earth as metal ducts can
ags heating systems typically consist of
usually it requires several years for the storage earth-mass to fully preheat from the local at-depth soil temperature which varies widely by region and site-orientation to an optimum fall level at which it can provide up to 100% of the heating requirements of the living space through the winter this technology continues to evolve with a range of variations including active-return devices being explored the listserve where this innovation is most often discussed is organic architecture at yahoo
this system is almost exclusively deployed in northern europe one system has been built at drake landing in north america a more recent system is a do-it-yourself energy-neutral home in progress in collinsville il that will rely solely on annualized solar for conditioning
