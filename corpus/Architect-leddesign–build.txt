design-build construction methods where the designer and constructor are the same entity or are on the same team rather than being hired separately by the owner began to make a resurgence in america at the end of the twentieth century most of these design-build projects were and are led by the contractor who hires an architect to design its building which the contractor then builds for its client the owner
more recently some architects have begun to embrace a lead role in the design-build approach they contract with the owner both to design and to construct a building and they procure the construction services either by subcontracting to a general contractor or by contracting directly with the various construction trades ironically although the notion of an architect leading a design-build team is considered new and innovative it is really a return to the construction approach employed for the millennia prior to the twentieth century in which the architect was the masterbuilder rather than merely the designer
the following definition describes assesses and compares the architect-led design–build aldb process to other related architectural project delivery methods it focuses on the architect’s role in each method and characterizes that role in terms of responsibility responsibility is interpreted in terms of how much direct contact with the client building owner and how much control over the project the architect has and how much risk the architect bears the architect's role and responsibilities may change in function of the geopolitical location of the development and other criteria
this definition of aldb outlines the broader context of design–build presenting that as an alternative to the traditional design–bid–build process for making buildings first this traditional process is introduced then the distinct forms of design–build are explained and from there the focus narrows to examine specific forms of the architect-led design build method what distinguishes it the benefits and limitations the results that it can achieve


of various approaches to making buildings the traditional design–bid–build process is one in which a building owner hires an architect to design a building and provide a complete set of design and construction documents drawings a pool of general contractors bid to deliver the project’s construction the architect is hired by the building owner to aid in selecting a general contractor from those bidding on the job the architect’s set of stamped completed and approved plans are handed off to the contracted gc to establish a contractual agreement which binds the contractor to build the building exactly as shown in the drawings approved plans  blue prints from the plansblue prints and under the gc’s supervision the project is built
the traditional design–bid–build approach remains suitable for many projects and where the architect remains in control of the project and beyond the design phase to supervise construction fully or otherwise it is definitely preferable it is also comprehensively governed and endorsed by the american institute of architects
this sequential process separates design and construction into independent tasks furthermore the owner’s two contracts – the first with the architect and the second with the general contractor – sets up discrete teams of specialists each may take too narrow a view of the whole and if with respective responsibilities unclear tasks overlap or are overlooked the parties’ relationship can become more adversarial than collaborative fear of the resulting litigation that often targets the architect can drive architects to absent themselves from the hurly-burly of the construction process if less involved on site the architect may lose opportunities to inform construction as an advocate for the client's vision and as a steward of the original design intent not only does this handover of responsibility diminish the architect's standing the lack of continuity may also compromise the quality of the project outcomes
not all design–build projects are alike here there is a distinction between design–build projects led by contractors and those led by architects architect-led design build is a form of ‘design–build’ that according to the dbia has been rapidly gaining market share in the united states over the past 15 years the design build institute of america describes the design–build process as follows
taking singular responsibility the design–build team is accountable for cost schedule and performance under a single contract and with reduced administrative paperwork clients can focus on the project rather than managing disparate contracts and by closing warranty gaps building owners also virtually eliminate litigation claims
the dbia's 2005 chart shows the uptake of design–build methods in non-residential design and construction in the united states
architect-led design–build is sometimes known by the more generic name designer-led design–build although employed primarily by architects architectural technologists and other architectural professions the design–build structure works similarly for interior design projects led by an interior designer who is not an architect and also for engineering projects where the design–build team is led by a professional structural civil mechanical or other engineers in addition it is common for the design professional who leads the design–build team to create a separate corporation or similar business entity through which the professional performs the construction and other related non-professional services
design–build continues to gain ground as a significant trend in design and construction today
in march 2011 industry consultants zweigwhite published design-bid-build meets the opposition in it they suggest that while design-bid-build still rules the traditional approach is losing favor as alternative project delivery methods threaten the design-bid-build model while not referencing the architect-led design–build approach specifically the article states that db already accounts for 27% of projects according to their 2010 project management survey and goes on to argue that
the emerging trends in delivery seem to point to a return to the primordial concept of the masterbuilder as exemplified by db and ipd integrated project delivery
the dynamic architect-led design–build workflow reintroduces discursive coordination collaboration and consistent reflexive managerial oversight over the arc of a project schedule maximizing project efficiency time cost functionality without compromising design performance or the quality of project outcomes design–build can be an iterative and dynamic method reflecting an emergent design process in which decisions are made holistically and progressively refined as interdependencies are prioritized identified and coordinated
on contractor-led design–build projects management is structured so that the owner works directly with a contractor who in turn coordinates subcontractors architects contribute to contractor-led design–build projects in one of several ways with varying degrees of responsibility where ae in each diagram represents the architectengineer
the architect works for the contractor as an in-house employee the architect still bears professional risk and is likely to have less control than in other contractor-led design–build approaches
here the architect is one of the many subcontractors on the team led by the contractor the architect bears similar professional risk but still with little control
the architect and contractor work together in a joint venture both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture the contractor leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs the architect might defer to the contractor the architect bears the same risk as they do in the traditional approach but has more control in ipd even if they were to defer to the contractor
architect-led design–build projects are those in which interdisciplinary teams of architects and building trades professionals collaborate in an agile management process where design strategy and construction expertise are seamlessly integrated and the architect as owner-advocate project-steward and team-leader ensures high fidelity between project aims and outcomes in architect-led design–build projects the architect works directly with the owner the client acts as the designer and builder coordinating a team of consultants subcontractors and materials suppliers throughout the project lifecycle
architects lead design–build projects in several ways with varying degrees of responsibility where ae in each diagram represents the architectengineer
contracted to the owner the architect extends his or her services beyond the design phase taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors on behalf of the owner the architect bears similar risk but has more control over the project than in the traditional approach or on contractor-led design–build projects
again as in c above the architect and contractor work together in a joint venture both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built again the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture this time the architect leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs the contractor might defer to the architect the architect might bear more risk than they do in the traditional approach but risk is shared with the owner and the contractor as outlined in their agreement an alternative approach to effectuating this delivery structure is for the architect to contract directly with the owner to design and build the project and then to subcontract the procurement and construction responsibilities to its allied general contractor who enters into further subcontracts with the trades this is a difference in form rather than in substance because the business and legal terms of the agreement between the architect and the general contractor may be the same regardless of whether they are characterized as a joint venture or as a subcontract it is the flip side of the coin of the contractor-led approach described above in which the general contractor subcontracts the design to the architect
contracted to the owner the architect offers full service to the owner taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors consultants and vendors and involving them throughout the project start to finish from design through construction the architect’s role shifts during the project from designer to site supervisor effectively taking the role of a general contractor but monitors the project vision and is able to call upon subcontractors’ construction expertise throughout the architect bears the greatest risk but also has more control over the project than in either the traditional approach or in the contractor-led and other architect-led design–build projects
in design–build projects led by architects the architect has the opportunity to lead the team through progressive iterations during the design–build process instead of producing sequential schematic design construction drawings and construction administration documents these continuous feedback loops extend the phase in which the team is dedicated to producing the most informed design each iteration is progressively informed by budgets continuously improving information and the best efficient construction techniques
the architect≠client relationship renegotiated
together client and architect can prioritize their decisions so choices can be made when the relevant information for making decisions is actually available this is in contrast to the typical process in which architects are constrained to make speculative choices without accurate cost or technical information and clients are invited to make decisions only at review milestones
here the architect is able to co-design with the client in an ongoing exchange throughout a project so the client retains more influence over the design and once on site is a more informed stakeholder during construction this way architect-led design–build can be co-creative and the most appropriate project outcomes can emerge from this active dialogue between clients designers and fabricators the process allows clients the opportunity to participate with full transparency in the financials of the project throughout its time-line
over the arc of a building project the architect’s strategic leadership role remains constant but their tasks may vary from
reintegrating practice towards a modern architecture throughout an architect-led design–build project design and construction considerations are inextricable from each other until each are optimized this design–build approach allows for a dynamic recursive process rather than a linear one for construction expertise early and design expertise late so rather than designing-then-building architect-led design–build works like this
challenging the split between design and construction
better business
in architect-led design–build projects the leading architect
above all the architect leading the design–build project empowers the architects and contractors to produce better cost effective higher quality context-sensitive high performance buildings how? by comprehending prioritizing and designing according to specific relationships between scope quality and time and by optimizing cost to program
so by inviting architects to lead design–build methods give architects a platform for advocating clients respecting craftsmanship and reasserting the value of architects’ expertise improving the built environment and for doing better business the more functional and less fearful the architect's business the more attention they can pay to producing high quality design outcomes
generating unique outcomes by replicable methods
consistent and recursive the design–build process can generate unique high quality buildings that improve and optimize the broader built environment and work for and are tailored to clients beyond the construction schedule within specific budgetary scheduling and site constraints by removing impediments mostly ascribed to aggressive risk management the approach broadens the scope for greater architectural creativity this way outcomes are more likely to respond to functionality synthesize context social intent and artistic sensibility
appropriate and successful application across a broad range of projects
architect-led design build is suited primarily to less prescriptive architectural projects private residences non-profit institutions museums for the efficiencies it yields and the sophisticated design interpretation it affords particularly
these less prescriptive projects need not be stuck with the broken buildings and busted budgets described by barry lepatner rather the less prescriptive the project the more the client needs an architect to steward an emergent design from vision to completion so it follows that for the broadest range of building projects the rigors of architect-led design–build is compelling and preferable where design is of paramount importance to the client
unifying strategy and practice
the architect-led design build process synthesizes strategy and craft so project outcomes cohere with client objectives connecting problem-solving ‘brains on’ design activities to physical outcomes ‘hands on’ construction activities as vernacular architecture and grand industrial crafts-led architecture have both done the architect-led design–build approach assumes that design decisions are informed and improved by knowledge of fabrication options tools and techniques and that construction will more likely match a client’s project objectives if it follows an overall design intention it is not a nostalgic endeavor but a reclamation of thinking and making a reintegration after mid-twentieth century specialization
flexible
a design–build process led by an architect can be open consistent tolerant to inevitable or necessary changes during construction transparent to all participating consultants it demystifies the decision-making process for clients as co-creators clients’ input informs design as it happens not just during the design phase in exchange architects leading a design build process maintain oversight of what gets built on behalf of clients rather than ceding control to contractors
generating recursive knowledge
the process and the knowledge it produces is recursive since subcontractors are engaged early and often in an architect-led design build project to assess efficiencies opportunity costs payback rates and quality options their input informs overall design decisions from the outset cost-benefit is also a constant consideration that informs design decisions from the outset building performance is measured early too so that trade offs between budget schedule functionality and usability can inform specification and continuous refinement of the design
architects engaged in this dynamic process understand and keep up to date with the potential of contemporary technology and materials available to building professionals and translate what they learn into their design work this knowledge is fed back not just to the specific project but can be shared to other project teams throughout a studio or more broadly to the profession and can become an active source of insight in and of itself
the architect leading the design–build project works with the client acting as the single point of contact to a unified team of end-to-end service providers including architects and construction trades people the architect as the aldb entity can guarantee the price for the complete structure to cover the building owner under a single contract determining where funds are best spent
a single set of integrated contracts combining design and construction responsibilities rather than two discrete contracts for each acknowledges the interdependence of the architects’ and construction trades’ project responsibilities and reduces the likelihood of disputes
advanced design-build strategies for architects by dorwin aj thomas formerly chairman of the american institute of architects aia design–build knowledge community includes more detail on contracts for design–build projects and further project examples
according to the dbia the design–build approach offers advantages to owners including one team one contract one unified flow of work from initial concept through completion
design–build architects learn from experience in a dynamic live process during an evolving project to achieve design goals and yield authentic outcomes from experience they are able to work with placeholders anticipating when to defer design decisions and trusting that as open-ended options become limited and details more precise a robust appropriate authentic design can and will emerge in this sense design–build is as much an art as it is a tried and trusted methodology
advocates of architect-led design build also offer critiques of the approach highlighting
issues that an architect-led approach to design–build still does not overcome
where architect-led design–build imposes
