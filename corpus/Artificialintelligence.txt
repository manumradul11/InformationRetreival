artificial intelligence ai is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software it is also the name of the academic field of study which studies how to create computers and computer software that are capable of intelligent behavior major ai researchers and textbooks define this field as the study and design of intelligent agents in which an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success john mccarthy who coined the term in 1955 defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines
ai research is highly technical and specialized and is deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other some of the division is due to social and cultural factors subfields have grown up around particular institutions and the work of individual researchers ai research is also divided by several technical issues some subfields focus on the solution of specific problems others focus on one of several possible approaches or on the use of a particular tool or towards the accomplishment of particular applications
the central problems or goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge planning learning natural language processing communication perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects general intelligence is still among the field's long-term goals currently popular approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic ai there are a large number of tools used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization logic methods based on probability and economics and many others the ai field is interdisciplinary in which a number of sciences and professions converge including computer science mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy and neuroscience as well as other specialized fields such as artificial psychology
the field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans human intelligence—the sapience of homo sapiens sapiens—can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it this raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence issues which have been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity artificial intelligence has been the subject of tremendous optimism but has also suffered stunning setbacks today it has become an essential part of the technology industry providing the heavy lifting for many of the most challenging problems in computer science


thinking machines and artificial beings appear in greek myths such as talos of crete the bronze robot of hephaestus and pygmalion's galatea human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization animated cult images were worshiped in egypt and greece and humanoid automatons were built by yan shi hero of alexandria and al-jazari it was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by jābir ibn hayyān judah loew and paracelsus by the 19th and 20th centuries artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction as in mary shelley's frankenstein or karel čapek's rur rossum's universal robots pamela mccorduck argues that all of these are some examples of an ancient urge as she describes it to forge the gods stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligence
mechanical or formal reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity the study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer based on the work of mathematician alan turing and others turing's theory of computation suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction this along with concurrent discoveries in neurology information theory and cybernetics inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brain
the field of ai research was founded at a conference on the campus of dartmouth college in the summer of 1956 the attendees including john mccarthy marvin minsky allen newell arthur samuel and herbert simon became the leaders of ai research for many decades they and their students wrote programs that were to most people simply astonishing computers were winning at checkers solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english by the middle of the 1960s research in the us was heavily funded by the department of defense and laboratories had been established around the world ai's founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field herbert simon predicted that machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do and marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation  the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved
they had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced in 1974 in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the us and british governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in ai the next few years would later be called an ai winter a period when funding for ai projects was hard to find
in the early 1980s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts by 1985 the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research in the field however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longer-lasting ai winter began
in the 1990s and early 21st century ai achieved its greatest successes albeit somewhat behind the scenes artificial intelligence is used for logistics data mining medical diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industry the success was due to several factors the increasing computational power of computers see moore's law a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems the creation of new ties between ai and other fields working on similar problems and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards
on 11 may 1997 deep blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov in february 2011 in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm's question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin the kinect which provides a 3d body–motion interface for the xbox 360 and the xbox one uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy ai research as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones in march 2016 alphago won 4 out of 5 games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer go-playing system to beat a professional human go player without handicaps
the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub-problems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention
early ai researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics
for difficult problems most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources – most experience a combinatorial explosion the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size the search for more efficient problem-solving algorithms is a high priority for ai research
human beings solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgements rather than the conscious step-by-step deduction that early ai research was able to model ai has made some progress at imitating this kind of sub-symbolic problem solving embodied agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning neural net research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill statistical approaches to ai mimic the probabilistic nature of the human ability to guess
knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to ai research many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world among the things that ai needs to represent are objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know and many other less well researched domains a representation of what exists is an ontology the set of objects relations concepts and so on that the machine knows about the most general are called upper ontologies which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge
among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are
intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them they need a way to visualize the future they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choices
in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be however if the agent is not the only actor it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty
multi-agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence
machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and has been central to ai research since the field's inception
unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression classification is used to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space these three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of decision theory using concepts like utility the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory
within developmental robotics developmental learning approaches were elaborated for lifelong cumulative acquisition of repertoires of novel skills by a robot through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning maturation motor synergies and imitation
natural language processing gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources such as newswire texts some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval or text mining question answering and machine translation
a common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing increases in processing speeds and the drop in the cost of data storage makes indexing large volumes of abstractions of the user's input much more efficient
machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones tactile sensors sonar and others more exotic to deduce aspects of the world computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input a few selected subproblems are speech recognition facial recognition and object recognition
the field of robotics is closely related to ai intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation and navigation with sub-problems of localization knowing where you are or finding out where other things are mapping learning what is around you building a map of the environment and motion planning figuring out how to get there or path planning going from one point in space to another point which may involve compliant motion – where the robot moves while maintaining physical contact with an object
among the long-term goals in the research pertaining to artificial intelligence are 1 social intelligence 2 creativity and 3 general intelligence
affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize interpret process and simulate human affects it is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences psychology and cognitive science while the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion the more modern branch of computer science originated with rosalind picard's 1995 paper on affective computing a motivation for the research is the ability to simulate empathy the machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them giving an appropriate response for those emotions
emotion and social skills play two roles for an intelligent agent first it must be able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states this involves elements of game theory decision theory as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions also in an effort to facilitate human-computer interaction an intelligent machine might want to be able to display emotions—even if it does not actually experience them itself—in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction
a sub-field of ai addresses creativity both theoretically from a philosophical and psychological perspective and practically via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative or systems that identify and assess creativity related areas of computational research are artificial intuition and artificial thinking
many researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence known as strong ai combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them a few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project
many of the problems above may require general intelligence to be considered solved for example even a straightforward specific task like machine translation requires that the machine read and write in both languages nlp follow the author's argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the author's intention social intelligence a problem like machine translation is considered ai-complete in order to solve this particular problem one must solve all the problems
there is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides ai research researchers disagree about many issues a few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology? or is human biology as irrelevant to ai research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering? can intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization? or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems? can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols similar to words and ideas? or does it require sub-symbolic processing? john haugeland who coined the term gofai good old-fashioned artificial intelligence also proposed that ai should more properly be referred to as synthetic intelligence a term which has since been adopted by some non-gofai researchers
in the 1940s and 1950s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology information theory and cybernetics some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as w grey walter's turtles and the johns hopkins beast many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the teleological society at princeton university and the ratio club in england by 1960 this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s
when access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation the research was centered in three institutions carnegie mellon university stanford and mit and each one developed its own style of research john haugeland named these approaches to ai good old fashioned ai or gofai during the 1960s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field
by the 1980s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into sub-symbolic approaches to specific ai problems
in the 1990s ai researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems these tools are truly scientific in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable and they have been responsible for many of ai's recent successes the shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or operations research stuart russell and peter norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats critics argue that these techniques with few exceptions are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long-term goal of general intelligence there is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in ai exemplified in part by exchanges between peter norvig and noam chomsky
in the course of 50 years of research ai has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general of these methods are discussed below
many problems in ai can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions reasoning can be reduced to performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means-ends analysis robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization
simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size
a very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization
evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses forms of evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming
logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic programming is a method for learning
several different forms of logic are used in ai research propositional or sentential logic is the logic of statements which can be true or false first-order logic also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other fuzzy logic is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1 rather than simply true 1 or false 0 fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems subjective logic models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a beta distribution by this method ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence
default logics non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and time causal calculus belief calculus and modal logics
many problems in ai in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics
bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectation-maximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters
a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design
the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience
a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches the most widely used classifiers are the neural network kernel methods such as the support vector machine k-nearest neighbor algorithm gaussian mixture model naive bayes classifier and decision tree the performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified there is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science
the study of artificial neural networks began in the decade before the field of ai research was founded in the work of walter pitts and warren mccullough other important early researchers were frank rosenblatt who invented the perceptron and paul werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithm
the main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and recurrent neural networks which allow feedback among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks among recurrent networks the most famous is the hopfield net a form of attractor network which was first described by john hopfield in 1982 neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control for robotics or learning using such techniques as hebbian learning and competitive learning
hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex the term deep learning gained traction in the mid-2000s after a publication by geoffrey hinton and ruslan salakhutdinov showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning
a deep neural network is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers similar to shallow artificial neural networks deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships over the last few years advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer
control theory the grandchild of cybernetics has many important applications especially in robotics
ai researchers have developed several specialized languages for ai research including lisp and prolog
in 1950 alan turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the turing test this procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested however it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail
artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry hand-writing recognition and game-playing such tests have been termed subject matter expert turing tests smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results
one classification for outcomes of an ai test is
for example performance at draughts ie checkers is optimal performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human see computer chess computers versus human and performance at many everyday tasks such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something is sub-human
a quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from kolmogorov complexity and data compression two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers
a derivative of the turing test is the completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart captcha as the name implies this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human in contrast to the standard turing test captcha administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine a computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test computers are unable to solve the problem so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test a common type of captcha is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer
artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect an area that artificial intelligence has contributed greatly to is intrusion detection
artificial intelligence technology is being applied to complex problems like finding trends in cancer research
there are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence the main areas promoted are general machine intelligence conversational behavior data-mining robotic cars robot soccer and games
a platform or computing platform is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework including application frameworks that allows software to run as rodney brooks pointed out many years ago it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the ai features of the platform but rather the actual platform itself that affects the ai that results ie there needs to be work in ai problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation
a wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of ai to develop ranging from expert systems such as cyc to deep-learning frameworks to robot platforms such as the roomba with open interface recent advances in deep artificial neural networks and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries including deeplearning4j tensorflow theano and torch
a technology startup called vicarious has come up with software that works like a human brain in one key way it can crack captchas the strings of tilted squiggly letters that websites employ to make users prove you are human as yahoo and others put it
aibo the first robotic pet grew out of sony's computer science laboratory csl famed engineer toshitada doi is credited as aibo's original progenitor in 1994 he had started work on robots with artificial intelligence expert masahiro fujita at csl doi's friend the artist hajime sorayama was enlisted to create the initial designs for the aibo's body those designs are now part of the permanent collections of museum of modern art and the smithsonian institution with later versions of aibo being used in studies in carnegie mellon university in 2006 aibo was added into carnegie mellon university's robot hall of fame
mark zuckerberg founder of facebook inc announced on january 3 2016 via his facebook page that his personal challenge for 2016 would be to build a simple ai to help him with work and to help run his home similar to jarvis from the iron man films some of the tasks that zuckerberg would like his ai to assist with include adjusting room temperature adjusting lighting anticipating needs and monitoring his newborn daughter maxima chan zuckerberg zuckerberg also hopes that his ai will feature and use voice and face recognition technologies which have already been successfully implemented in the technology of facebook he plans to advance the current technology of artificial intelligence which is good at recognizing patterns by teaching common sense through an approach called supervised learning zuckerberg does not expect to have the ai built within the 2016 year but is glad to be joining the effort that is pushing the field of ai forward
there are three philosophical questions related to ai
can a machine be intelligent? can it think?
as a minimum an ai system must be able to reproduce aspects of human intelligence this raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other ai agents this issue was addressed by wendell wallach in his book titled moral machines in which he introduced the concept of artificial moral agents ama for wallach amas have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as does humanity want computers making moral decisions and can robots really be moral for wallach the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the constraints which society may place on the development of amas
the field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making the field was delineated in the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems — it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about ethics machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality computational ethics or computational morality a variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition machine ethics  that stems from the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics
political scientist charles t rubin believes that ai can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent he argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind and would be extremely difficult to stop this topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization humans and planet earth
physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and spacex founder elon musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that ai could evolve to the point that humans could not control it with hawking theorizing that this could spell the end of the human race
one proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent ai is 'friendly ai' and will then be able to control subsequently developed ais some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place
leading ai researcher rodney brooks writes i think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent ai anytime in the next few hundred years i think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of ai and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence
joseph weizenbaum wrote that ai applications can not by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of ai technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy was deeply misguided weizenbaum was also bothered that ai researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism to weizenbaum these points suggest that ai research devalues human life
martin ford author of the lights in the tunnel automation accelerating technology and the economy of the future and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems machine learning and other ai-enhanced applications ai-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work
if an ai system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence will that system also be sentient – will it have a mind which has conscious experiences? this question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness
computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain or both is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hillary putnam
searle's strong ai hypothesis states that the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds john searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be
mary shelley's frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel? if it can feel does it have the same rights as a human? the idea also appears in modern science fiction such as the film ai artificial intelligence in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions this issue now known as robot rights is currently being considered by for example california's institute for the future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature the subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film plug & pray
are there limits to how intelligent machines – or human-machine hybrids – can be? a superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind ‘’superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent
if research into strong ai produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive self-improvement the new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario singularity technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control thus radically changing or even ending civilization because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable
ray kurzweil has used moore's law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045
you awake one morning to find your brain has another lobe functioning invisible this auxiliary lobe answers your questions with information beyond the realm of your own memory suggests plausible courses of action and asks questions that help bring out relevant facts you quickly come to rely on the new lobe so much that you stop wondering how it works you just use it this is the dream of artificial intelligence
robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism which has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger has been illustrated in fiction as well for example in the manga ghost in the shell and the science-fiction series dune
in the 1980s artist hajime sorayama's sexy robots series were painted and published in japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later the gynoids book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including george lucas and other creatives sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form
edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler's darwin among the machines 1863 and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998
the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race -stephen hawking
a common concern about the development of artificial intelligence is the potential threat it could pose to mankind this concern has recently gained attention after mentions by celebrities including stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk the opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable ai
in his book superintelligence nick bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to mankind he argues that sufficiently intelligent ai if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down if this ai's goals do not reflect humanity's - one example is an ai told to compute as many digits of pi as possible - it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down ultimately to better achieve its goal
for this danger to be realized the hypothetical ai would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence
