the atomic age also known as the atomic era is the period of history following the detonation of the first nuclear atomic bomb trinity on july 16 1945 during world war ii although nuclear chain reactions had been hypothesized in 1933 and the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction chicago pile-1 had taken place in december 1942 the trinity test and the ensuing bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in japan that ended world war ii represented the first large-scale use of nuclear technology and ushered in profound changes in sociopolitical thinking and the course of technology development atomic power was seen to be the epitome of progress and modernity
in 1973 the united states atomic energy commission predicted that by the turn of the 21st century one thousand reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the usa however the nuclear dream fell far short of what was promised because nuclear technology produced a range of social problems from the nuclear arms race to nuclear meltdowns and the unresolved difficulties of bomb plant cleanup and civilian plant waste disposal and decommissioning after 1973 reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled
by the late 1970s nuclear power had suffered a remarkable international destabilization as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread public opposition coming to a head with the three mile island accident in 1979 and the chernobyl disaster in 1986 both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for many decades


in 1901 frederick soddy and ernest rutherford discovered that radioactivity was part of the process by which atoms changed from one kind to another involving the release of energy soddy wrote in popular magazines that radioactivity was a potentially inexhaustible source of energy and offered a vision of an atomic future where it would be possible to transform a desert continent thaw the frozen poles and make the whole earth one smiling garden of eden the promise of an atomic age with nuclear energy as the global utopian technology for the satisfaction of human needs has been a recurring theme ever since but soddy also saw that atomic energy could possibly be used to create terrible new weapons
the concept of a nuclear chain reaction was hypothesized in 1933 shortly after chadwick's discovery of the neutron only a few years later in december 1938 nuclear fission was discovered by otto hahn and his assistant fritz strassmann and proved with hahn's radiochemical methods the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction chicago pile-1 or cp-1 took place in december 1942 under the leadership of enrico fermi
in 1945 the pocketbook the atomic age heralded the untapped atomic power in everyday objects and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused one science writer david dietz wrote that instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill glenn t seaborg who chaired the atomic energy commission wrote there will be nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles nuclear powered artificial hearts plutonium heated swimming pools for scuba divers and much more
the phrase atomic age was coined by william l laurence a new york times journalist who became the official journalist for the manhattan project which developed the first nuclear weapons he witnessed both the trinity test and the bombing of nagasaki and went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon his reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and in part motivated development of the technology in the us and in the soviet union the soviet union would go on to test its first nuclear weapon in 1949
in 1949 us atomic energy commission chairman david lilienthal stated that atomic energy is not simply a search for new energy but more significantly a beginning of human history in which faith in knowledge can vitalize man's whole life
the phrase gained popularity as a feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature the atomic bomb would render all conventional explosives obsolete and nuclear power plants would do the same for power sources such as coal and oil there was a general feeling that everything would use a nuclear power source of some sort in a positive and productive way from irradiating food to preserve it to the development of nuclear medicine there would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty irrigate the deserts for the hungry and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space this use would render the atomic age as significant a step in technological progress as the first smelting of bronze of iron or the commencement of the industrial revolution
this included even cars leading ford to display the ford nucleon concept car to the public in 1958 there was also the promise of golf balls which could always be found and nuclear-powered aircraft which the us federal government even spent us $1.5 billion researching nuclear policymaking became almost a collective technocratic fantasy or at least was driven by fantasy
the very idea of splitting the atom had an almost magical grip on the imaginations of inventors and policymakers as soon as someone said – in an even mildly credible way – that these things could be done then people quickly convinced themselves  that they would be done
in the usa military planners believed that demonstrating the civilian applications of the atom would also affirm the american system of private enterprise showcase the expertise of scientists increase personal living standards and defend the democratic lifestyle against communism
some media reports predicted that thanks to the giant nuclear power stations of the near future electricity would soon become much cheaper and that electricity meters would be removed because power would be too cheap to meter
the reality was that the shippingport reactor went online in 1957 producing electricity at a cost roughly ten times that of coal-fired generation scientists at the aec's own brookhaven laboratory wrote a 1958 report describing accident scenarios in which 3000 people would die immediately with another 40000 injured
fear of possible atomic attack from the soviet union caused us school children to participate in duck and cover civil defense drills
in the late 1950s there was a stadium north of las vegas nevada where tourists gathered wearing special sunglasses to watch above-ground nuclear weapons tests taking place at the nevada test sitecitation needed
by exploiting the peaceful uses of the friendly atom in medical applications earth removal and subsequently in nuclear power plants the nuclear industry and government sought to allay public fears about nuclear technology and promote the acceptance of nuclear weapons at the peak of the atomic age the united states government initiated operation plowshare involving peaceful nuclear explosions the united states atomic energy commission chairman announced that the plowshares project was intended to highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests
project plowshare was named directly from the bible itself specifically micah 43 which states that god will beat swords into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks so that no country could lift up weapons against another proposed uses included widening the panama canal constructing a new sea-level waterway through nicaragua nicknamed the pan-atomic canal cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways and connecting inland river systems other proposals involved blasting underground caverns for water natural gas and petroleum storage it was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to extract shale oil in eastern utah and western colorado serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations one proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground aquifers in arizona another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of california's sacramento valley for a water transport project however there were many negative impacts from project plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions consequences included blighted land relocated communities tritium-contaminated water radioactivity and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere these were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977 due in large part to public opposition after $770 million had been spent on the project
in the thunderbirds tv series a set of vehicles was presented that were imagined to be completely nuclear as shown in cutaways presented in their comic-books
the term atomic age was initially used in a positive futuristic sense but by the 1960s the threats posed by nuclear weapons had begun to edge out nuclear power as the dominant motif of the atom
french advocates of nuclear power developed an aesthetic vision of nuclear technology as art to bolster support for the technology leclerq compares the nuclear cooling tower to some of the grandest architectural monuments of western culture
the age in which we live has for the public been marked by the nuclear engineer and the gigantic edifices he has created for builders and visitors alike nuclear power plants will be considered the cathedrals of the 20th century their syncretism mingles the conscious and the unconscious religious fulfilment and industrial achievement the limitations of uses of materials and boundless artistic inspiration utopia come true and the continued search for harmony
in 1973 the united states atomic energy commission predicted that by the turn of the 21st century one thousand reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the usa but after 1973 reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled
by the late 1970s nuclear power suffered a remarkable international destabilization as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread public opposition coming to a head with the three mile island accident in 1979 and the chernobyl disaster in 1986 both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for decades thereafter a cover story in the february 11 1985 issue of forbes magazine commented on the overall management of the nuclear power program in the united states
the failure of the us nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history a disaster on a monumental scale … only the blind or the biased can now think that the money has been well spent it is a defeat for the us consumer and for the competitiveness of us industry for the utilities that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system that made it possible
so in a period just over 30 years the early dramatic rise of nuclear power went into equally meteoric reverse with no other energy technology has there been a conjunction of such rapid and revolutionary international emergence followed so quickly by equally transformative demise
in the 21st century the label of the atomic age connotes either a sense of nostalgia or naïveté and is considered by many to have ended with the fall of the soviet union in 1991 though the term continues to be used by many historians to describe the era following the conclusion of the second world war atomic energy and weapons continue to have a strong effect on world politics in the 21st century the term is used by some science fiction fans to describe not only the era following the conclusion of the second world war but also contemporary history up to the present day
the nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors and has proposed new safer but generally untested reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed built and operated correctly mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at fukushima in japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake according to ubs ag the fukushima i nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like japan can master nuclear safety catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable an interdisciplinary team from mit has estimated that if nuclear power use tripled from 2005–2055 from 2% to 7% at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period
in september 2012 japan announced that it would completely phase out nuclear power by 2030 although under the abe administration this is now unlikey with germany and other countries in reaction to the accident at fukushima germany plans to completely phase-out nuclear energy by 2022
