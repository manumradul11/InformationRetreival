an azimuth iˈæzɪməθ from arabic al-sumūt meaning the directions is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system the vector from an observer origin to a point of interest is projected perpendicularly onto a reference plane the angle between the projected vector and a reference vector on the reference plane is called the azimuth
an example is the position of a star in the sky the star is the point of interest the reference plane is the horizon or the surface of the sea and the reference vector points north the azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the perpendicular projection of the star down onto the horizon
azimuth is usually measured in degrees ° the concept is used in navigation astronomy engineering mapping mining and artillery


in land navigation azimuth is usually denoted alpha  and defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from a north base line or meridian azimuth has also been more generally defined as a horizontal angle measured clockwise from any fixed reference plane or easily established base direction line
today the reference plane for an azimuth is typically true north measured as a 0° azimuth though other angular units grad mil can be used moving clockwise on a 360 degree circle east has azimuth 90° south 180° and west 270° there are exceptions some navigation systems use south as the reference vector any direction can be the reference vector as long as it is clearly defined
quite commonly azimuths or compass bearings are stated in a system in which either north or south can be the zero and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero for example a bearing might be described as from south turn thirty degrees toward the east the words in brackets are usually omitted abbreviated s30°e which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south ie the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north the reference direction stated first is always north or south and the turning direction stated last is east or west the directions are chosen so that the angle stated between them is positive between zero and 90 degrees if the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the cardinal points a different notation eg due east is used instead
the cartographical azimuth in decimal degrees can be calculated when the coordinates of 2 points are known in a flat plane cartographical coordinates
remark that the reference axes are swapped relative to the counterclockwise mathematical polar coordinate system and that the azimuth is clockwise relative to the north this is the reason why the x and y axis in the above formula are swapped if the azimuth becomes negative one can always add 360°
the formula in radians would be a bit easier
when the coordinates x1 y1 of one point the distance l and the azimuth α to another point x2 y2 are known one can calculate its coordinates
this is typically used in triangulation
we are standing at latitude  longitude zero we want to find the azimuth from our viewpoint to point 2 at latitude  longitude l positive eastward we can get a fair approximation by assuming the earth is a sphere in which case the azimuth is given by
a better approximation assumes the earth is a slightly-squashed sphere an oblate spheroid azimuth then has at least two very slightly different meanings normal-section azimuth is the angle measured at our viewpoint by a theodolite whose axis is perpendicular to the surface of the spheroid geodetic azimuth is the angle between north and the geodesic that is the shortest path on the surface of the spheroid from our viewpoint to point 2 the difference is usually immeasurably small if point 2 is not more than 100 km away the difference will not exceed 0.03 arc second
various websites will calculate geodetic azimuth eg geoscience australia site formulas for calculating geodetic azimuth are linked in the distance article
normal-section azimuth is simpler to calculate bomford says cunningham's formula is exact for any distancecitation needed if is the flattening for the chosen spheroid eg 1298.257223563 for wgs84 then
if = 0 then
to calculate the azimuth of the sun or a star given its declination and hour angle at our location we modify the formula for a spherical earth replace with declination and longitude difference with hour angle and change the sign since hour angle is positive westward instead of east
there is a wide variety of azimuthal map projections they all have the property that directions the azimuths from a central point are preserved some navigation systems use south as the reference plane however any direction can serve as the plane of reference as long as it is clearly defined for everyone using that system
used in celestial navigation an azimuth is the direction of a celestial body from the observer in astronomy an azimuth is sometimes referred to as a bearing in modern astronomy azimuth is nearly always measured from the north the article on coordinate systems for example uses a convention measuring from the south in former times it was common to refer to azimuth from the south as it was then zero at the same time that the hour angle of a star was zero this assumes however that the star upper culminates in the south which is only true if the star's declination is less than ie further south than the observer's latitude
if instead of measuring from and along the horizon the angles are measured from and along the celestial equator the angles are called right ascension if referenced to the vernal equinox or hour angle if referenced to the celestial meridian
in the horizontal coordinate system used in celestial navigation and satellite dish installation azimuth is one of the two coordinates the other is altitude sometimes called elevation above the horizon see also sat finder
in mathematics the azimuth angle of a point in cylindrical coordinates or spherical coordinates is the anticlockwise angle between the positive x-axis and the projection of the vector onto the xy-plane the angle is the same as an angle in polar coordinates of the component of the vector in the xy-plane and is normally measured in radians rather than degrees as well as measuring the angle differently in mathematical applications theta  is very often used to represent the azimuth rather than the symbol phi 
for magnetic tape drives azimuth refers to the angle between the tape heads and tape
in sound localization experiments and literature the azimuth refers to the angle the sound source makes compared to the imaginary straight line that is drawn from within the head through the area between the eyes
an azimuth thruster in shipbuilding is a propeller that can be rotated horizontally
the word azimuth is in all european languages today it originates from medieval arabic al-sumūt pronounced as-sumūt in arabic meaning the directions plural of arabic al-samt = the direction the arabic word entered late medieval latin in an astronomy context and in particular in the use of the arabic version of the astrolabe astronomy instrument the word's first record in english is in the 1390s in treatise on the astrolabe by geoffrey chaucer the first known record in any western language is in spanish in the 1270s in an astronomy book that was largely derived from arabic sources the libros del saber de astronomía commissioned by king alfonso x of castile
