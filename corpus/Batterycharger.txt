a battery charger or recharger is a device used to put energy into a secondary cell or rechargeable battery by forcing an electric current through it
the charging protocol depends on the size and type of the battery being charged some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source simple chargers of this type require manual disconnection at the end of the charge cycle or may have a timer to cut off charging current at a fixed time other battery types cannot withstand long high-rate over-charging the charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to adjust the charging current determine the state of charge and cut off at the end of charge
a trickle charger provides a relatively small amount of current only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time slow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge high-rate chargers may restore most capacity within minutes or less than an hour but generally require monitoring of the battery to protect it from overcharge electric vehicles need high-rate chargers for public access installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars


charge and discharge rates are often denoted as c or c-rate which is a measure of the rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to the capacity of the battery the c-rate is given by the numerical value of the ratio of the charging or discharging current in a to the capacity of the battery in ah
for example for a battery with a capacity of 500mah the current corresponding to a c-rate of 10 and a charge or discharge time of 6 minutes would be 5000ma or 5a while the current corresponding to a c-rate of 12 and a charge or discharge time of 2 hours would be 250ma 
very rapid charging rates 1 hour or less generally require the charger to carefully monitor battery parameters such as terminal voltage and temperature to prevent overcharging and damage to the cellscitation needed
a simple charger works by supplying a constant dc or pulsed dc power source to a battery being charged the simple charger does not alter its output based on time or the charge on the battery this simplicity means that a simple charger is inexpensive but there is a tradeoff in quality typically a simple charger takes longer to charge a battery to prevent severe over-charging even so a battery left in a simple charger for too long will be weakened or destroyed due to over-charging these chargers can supply either a constant voltage or a constant current to the battery
simple ac-powered battery chargers have much higher ripple current and ripple voltage than other kinds of battery supplies when the ripple current is within the battery-manufacturer-recommended level the ripple voltage will also be well within the recommended level the maximum ripple current for a typical 12 v 100 ah vrla battery is 5 amps as long as the ripple current is not excessive more than 3 to 4 times the battery-manufacturer-recommended level the expected life of a ripple-charged vrla battery is within 3% of the life of a constant dc-charged battery
fast chargers make use of control circuitry in the batteries being charged to rapidly charge the batteries without damaging the cells' elements most such chargers have a cooling fan to help keep the temperature of the cells under control most are also capable of acting as standard overnight chargers if used with standard nimh cells that do not have the special control circuitry
inductive battery chargers use electromagnetic induction to charge batteries a charging station sends electromagnetic energy through inductive coupling to an electrical device which stores the energy in the batteries this is achieved without the need for metal contacts between the charger and the battery it is commonly used in electric toothbrushes and other devices used in bathrooms because there are no open electrical contacts there is no risk of electrocution
a smart charger should not be confused with a smart battery a smart battery is generally defined as one containing some sort of electronic device or chip that can communicate with a smart charger about battery characteristics and condition a smart battery generally requires a smart charger it can communicate with see smart battery data a smart charger is defined as a charger that can respond to the condition of a battery and modify its charging actions accordingly
some smart chargers are designed to charge
the output current of a smart charger depends upon the battery's state an intelligent charger may monitor the battery's voltage temperature or time under charge to determine the optimum charge current and to terminate charging
for ni-cd and nimh batteries the voltage across the battery increases slowly during the charging process until the battery is fully charged after that the voltage decreases which indicates to an intelligent charger that the battery is fully charged such chargers are often labeled as a δv delta-v or sometimes delta peak charger indicating that they monitor the voltage change
the problem is the magnitude of delta-v can become very small or even non-existent if very highquantify capacity rechargeable batteries are rechargedcitation needed this can cause even an intelligent battery charger to not sense that the batteries are actually already fully charged and continue charging overcharging of the batteries will result in some cases however many so called intelligent chargers employ a combination of cut off systems which should prevent overcharging in the vast majority of cases
a typical intelligent charger fast-charges a battery up to about 85% of its maximum capacity in less than an hour then switches to trickle charging which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity
several companies have begun making devices that charge batteries based on regular human motion one example made by tremont electric consists of a magnet held between two springs that can charge a battery as the device is moved up and down such as when walking such products have not yet achieved significant commercial success
some chargers use pulse technology in which a series of voltage or current pulses is fed to the battery the dc pulses have a strictly controlled rise time pulse width pulse repetition rate frequency and amplitude this technology is said to work with any size voltage capacity or chemistry of batteries including automotive and valve-regulated batteries with pulse charging high instantaneous voltages can be applied without overheating the battery in a lead–acid battery this breaks down lead-sulfate crystals thus greatly extending the battery service life
several kinds of pulse charging are patented others are open source hardware
some chargers use pulses to check the current battery state when the charger is first connected then use constant current charging during fast charging then use pulse charging as a kind of trickle charging to maintain the charge
some chargers use negative pulse charging also called reflex charging or burp charging such chargers use both positive and brief negative current pulses there is no significant evidence however that negative pulse charging is more effective than ordinary pulse charging
solar chargers convert light energy into dc current they are generally portable but can also be fixed mount fixed mount solar chargers are also known as solar panels solar panels are often connected to the electrical grid whereas portable solar chargers are used off-the-grid ie cars boats or rvs
the output of a timer charger is terminated after a pre-determined time timer chargers were the most common type for high-capacity ni-cd cells in the late 1990s for example low-capacity consumer ni-cd cells were typically charged with a simple charger
often a timer charger and set of batteries could be bought as a bundle and the charger time was set to suit those batteries if batteries of lower capacity were charged then they would be overcharged and if batteries of higher capacity were charged they would be only partly charged with the trend for battery technology to increase capacity year on year an old timer charger would only partly charge the newer batteries
timer based chargers also had the drawback that charging batteries that were not fully discharged even if those batteries were of the correct capacity for the particular timed charger would result in over-charging
a trickle charger is typically a low-current 5–1500 ma battery charger a trickle charger is generally used to charge small capacity batteries 2–30 ah these types of battery chargers are also used to maintain larger capacity batteries > 30 ah that are typically found on cars boats rvs and other related vehicles in larger applications the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers depending on the technology of the trickle charger it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are also referred to as smart or intelligent chargers
the most sophisticated types are used in critical applications eg military or aviation batteries these heavy-duty automatic intelligent charging systems can be programmed with complex charging cycles specified by the battery maker the best are universal ie can charge all battery types and include automatic capacity testing and analyzing functions too
since the universal serial bus specification provides for a five-volt power supply it is possible to use a usb cable to connect a device to a power supply products based on this approach include chargers for cellular phones portable digital audio players and tablet computers they may be fully compliant usb peripheral devices adhering to usb power discipline or uncontrolled in the manner of usb decorations although portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only they still can depending on the technology be used in low light ie cloudy applications portable solar chargers are typically used for trickle charging although some solar chargers depending on the wattage can completely recharge batteries other devices may exist which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy
powerbanks are mostly popular for charging smartphones and mobile tablet devices a powerbank is a portable device that can supply usb power using stored energy in its built-in batteries powerbanks usually recharge with usb power supply basically powerbanks comprises the rechargeable batteries consisting of either lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells and comes under protective casing guided by sophisticated pcb ensuring various protective and safety measures
specifications
since a battery charger is intended to be connected to a battery it may not have voltage regulation or filtering of the dc voltage output battery chargers equipped with both voltage regulation and filtering may be identified as battery eliminators
there are two main types of charges for vehicles
chargers for car batteries come in varying ratings chargers that are rated up to two amperes may be used to maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment a motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter
electric vehicle battery chargers come in a variety of brands and characteristics zivan manzanita micro elcon quick charge rossco brusa delta-q kelly lester and soneil are the top 10 ev chargers in 2011 according to evalbumcom these chargers vary from 1 kw to 7.5 kw maximum charge rate some use algorithm charge curves others use constant voltage constant current some are programmable by the end user through a can port some have dials for maximum voltage and amperage some are preset to specified battery pack voltage amp-hour and chemistry prices range from $400 to $4500
a 10 amp-hour battery could take 15 hours to reach a fully charged state from a fully discharged condition with a 1 amp charger as it would require roughly 1.5 times the battery's capacity
public ev charging stations provide 6 kw host power of 208 to 240 vac off a 40 amp circuit 6 kw will recharge an ev roughly 6 times faster than 1 kw overnight charging
rapid charging results in even faster recharge times and is limited only by available ac power and the type of charging system
onboard ev chargers change ac power to dc power to recharge the ev's pack can be
power factor correction pfc chargers can more closely approach the maximum current the plug can deliver shortening charging time
there is a list of public ev charging stations in the usa and worldwide
project better place was deploying a network of charging stations and subsidizing vehicle battery costs through leases and credits until filing for bankruptcy in may 2013
researchers at the korea advanced institute of science and technology kaist have developed an electric transport system called online electric vehicle olev where the vehicles get their power needs from cables underneath the surface of the road via non-contact magnetic charging where a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself
most mobile phone chargers are not really chargers only power adapters that provide a power source for the charging circuitry which is almost always contained within the mobile phone older ones are notoriously diverse having a wide variety of dc connector-styles and voltages most of which are not compatible with other manufacturers' phones or even different models of phones from a single manufacturer
users of publicly accessible charging kiosks must be able to cross-reference connectors with device brandsmodels and individual charge parameters and thus ensure delivery of the correct charge for their mobile device a database-driven system is one solution and is being incorporated into some designs of charging kiosks
mobile phones can usually accept a relatively wide range of voltagescitation needed as long as it is sufficiently above the phone battery's voltage however if the voltage is too high it can damage the phone mostly the voltage is 5 volts or slightly higher but it can sometimes vary up to 12 volts when the power source is not loadedcitation needed
there are also human-powered chargers sold on the market which typically consists of a dynamo powered by a hand crank and extension cords a french startup offers a kind of dynamo charger inspired by the ratchet that can be used with only one hand there are also solar chargers including one that is a fully mobile personal charger and panel which you can easily transport
china the european commission and other countries are making a national standard on mobile phone chargers using the usb standard in june 2009 10 of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed a memorandum of understanding to develop specifications for and support a microusb-equipped common external power supply eps for all data-enabled mobile phones sold in the eu on october 22 2009 the international telecommunication union announced a standard for a universal charger for mobile handsets micro-usb
telecommunications electric power and computer uninterruptible power supply facilities may have very large standby battery banks installed in battery rooms to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation supervisory alarms for various system faults and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the battery to be disconnected for maintenance while the charger supplies the dc system load capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within say 8 hours or other interval
a battery charger can work as a dc power adapter for experimentation it may however require an external capacitor to be connected across its output terminals in order to smooth the voltage sufficiently which may be thought of as a dc voltage plus a ripple voltage added to it there may be an internal resistance connected to limit the short circuit current and the value of that internal resistance may have to be taken into consideration in experiments
what practices are best depend on the type of battery nicd cells need to be fully discharged occasionally or else the battery loses capacity over time in a phenomenon known as memory effect once a month once every 30 charges is sometimes recommendedcitation needed this extends the life of the battery since memory effect is prevented while avoiding full charge cycles which are known to be hard on all types of dry-cell batteries eventually resulting in a permanent decrease in battery capacity
most modern cell phones laptops and most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries these batteries last longest if the battery is frequently charged fully discharging them will degrade their capacity relatively quicklycitation needed when storing however lithium batteries degrade more while fully charged than if they are only 40% charged degradation also occurs faster at higher temperatures degradation in lithium-ion batteries is caused by an increased internal battery resistance due to cell oxidation this decreases the efficiency of the battery resulting in less net current available to be drawn from the batterycitation needed however if li-ion cells are discharged below a certain voltage a chemical reaction occurs that make them dangerous if recharged which is why probably all such batteries in consumer goods now have an electronic fuse that permanently disables them if the voltage falls below a set level the electronic fuse draws a small amount of current from the battery which means that if a laptop battery is left for a long time without charging it and with a very low initial state of charge the battery may be permanently destroyed
motor vehicles such as boats rvs atvs motorcycles cars trucks and more use lead–acid batteries these batteries employ a sulfuric acid electrolyte and can generally be charged and discharged without exhibiting memory effect though sulfation a chemical reaction in the battery which deposits a layer of sulfates on the lead will occur over time typically sulfated batteries are simply replaced with new batteries and the old ones recycled lead–acid batteries will experience substantially longer life when a maintenance charger is used to float charge the battery this prevents the battery from ever being below 100% charge preventing sulfate from forming proper temperature compensated float voltage should be used to achieve the best results
