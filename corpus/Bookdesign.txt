book design is the art of incorporating the content style format design and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole
in the words of jan tschichold book design though largely forgotten today methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries to produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied richard hendel describes book design as an arcane subject and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means


front matter or preliminaries prelims for short is the first section of a book and is usually the smallest section in terms of the number of pages the pages are numbered in lower-case roman numerals each page is counted but no folio or page number is expressed or printed on either display pages or blank pagescitation needed
front matter generally only appears in the first volume in a multi-volume work although some elements such as a table of contents or index may appear in each volume
the following table will help distinguish between some of the different types of front matter
the structure of a work and especially of its body matter is often described hierarchically
the following are two instructive examples
the back matter also known as end matter if used normally consists of one or more of the following components
the front cover is the front of the book and is marked appropriately by text andor graphics in order to identify it as such namely as the very beginning of the book the front cover usually contains at least the title andor author with possibly an appropriate illustration
on the inside of the cover page extending to the facing page is the front endpaper sometimes referred as fep the free half of the end paper is called a flyleaf traditionally in hand-bound books the endpaper was just a sheet of blank or ornamented paper physically masking and reinforcing the connection between the cover and the body of the book in modern publishing it can be either plain as in many text-oriented books or variously ornamented and illustrated in books such as picture books other children's literature some arts and craft and hobbyist books noveltygift-market and coffee table books and graphic novels these books have an audience and traditions of their own where the graphic design and immediacy is especially important and publishing tradition and formality are less important the spine is the vertical edge of a book as it normally stands on a bookshelf it is customary for it to have printed text on it in texts published andor printed in the united states and the united kingdom the spine text when vertical runs from the top to the bottom such that it is right side up when the book is lying flat with the front cover on top in books from continental europe vertical spine text traditionally runs from the bottom up though this convention has been changing lately the spine usually contains all or some of four elements besides decoration if any and in the following order 1 author editor or compiler 2 title 3 publisher and 4 publisher logo
on the inside of the back cover page extending from the facing page before it is the endpaper its design matches the front endpaper and in accordance with it contains either plain paper or pattern image etc
the back cover often contains biographical matter about the author or editor and quotes from other sources praising the book it may also contain a summary or description of the book
books are classified under two categories according to the physical nature of their binding the designation hardcover or hardback refers to books with stiff covers as opposed to flexible ones the binding of a hardcover book usually includes boards often made of paperboard covered in cloth leather or other materials the binding is usually sewn to the pages using string stitching
a less expensive binding method is that used for paperback books sometimes called softback or softcover most paperbacks are bound with paper or light cardboard though other materials such as plastic are used the covers are flexible and usually bound to the pages using glue perfect binding some small paperback books are sub-classified as pocketbooks these paperbacks are smaller than usual - small enough to barely fit into a pocket especially the back pocket of one's trousers however this capacity to fit into a pocket diminishes with increasing number of pages and increasing thickness of the book such a book may still be designated as a pocketbook
some books such as bibles or dictionaries may have a thumb index to help find material quickly
gold leaf may also be applied to the edges of the pages so that when closed the side top and bottom of the book have a golden color on some books a design may be printed on the edges or marbling or a simple colour applied some artist's books go even further by using fore-edge painting
pop-up elements and fold-out pages may be used to add dimensions to the page in different ways
children's books commonly incorporate a wide array of design features built into the fabric of the book die-cut techniques in the work of eric carle are one example clear or reflective surfaces flaps textiles and scratch-and-sniff are other possible features
a basic unit in book design is the page spread the left page called verso and right page called recto are of the same size and aspect ratio and are centered on the gutter where they are bound together at the spine
the design of each individual page on the other hand is governed by the canons of page construction
the possible layout of the sets of letters of the alphabet or words on a page is determined by the so-called print space and is also an element in the design of the page of the book clearly there must be sufficient space at the spine of the book if the text is to be visible on the other hand the other three margins of the page which frame the book are made of the appropriate size for both practical and aesthetic reasons
the print space german satzspiegel is a typographic term and determines the effective area on the paper of a book journal or other press work the print space is limited by the surrounding borders or in other words the gutters outside the printed area
the german term comes originally from hot metal typesetting above the desktop was a mirror german spiegel where the typesetter could read the inverted letters
