a borehole is a narrow shaft bored in the ground either vertically or horizontally a borehole may be constructed for many different purposes including the extraction of water other liquids such as petroleum or gases such as natural gas as part of a geotechnical investigation environmental site assessment mineral exploration temperature measurement as a pilot hole for installing piers or underground utilities for geothermal installations or for underground storage of unwanted substances eg in carbon capture and storage


engineers and environmental consultants use the term borehole to collectively describe all of the various types of holes drilled as part of a geotechnical investigation or environmental site assessment a so-called phase ii esa this includes holes advanced to collect soil samples water samples or rock cores to advance in situ sampling equipment or to install monitoring wells or piezometers samples collected from boreholes are often tested in a laboratory to determine their physical properties or to assess levels of various chemical constituents or contaminants
typically a borehole used as a water well is completed by installing a vertical pipe casing and well screen to keep the borehole from caving this also helps prevent surface contaminants from entering the borehole and protects any installed pump from drawing in sand and sediment oil and natural gas wells are completed in a similar albeit usually more complex manner
as detailed in proxy climate borehole temperature measurements at a series of different depths can be effectively inverted a mathematical formula to solve a matrix equation to help estimate historic surface temperatures
clusters of small-diameter boreholes equipped with heat exhangers made of plastic pex pipe can be used to store heat or cold between opposing seasons in a mass of native rock the technique is called seasonal thermal energy storage mediums that can be used for this technique range from gravel to bedrock there can be a few to several hundred boreholes and in practice depths have ranged from 150 to 1000 feet
borehole drilling has a long history han dynasty china 202 bc – 220 ad used deep borehole drilling for mining and other projects chinese borehole sites could reach as deep as 600 m 2000 ft the practice of well logging in boreholes dates to 1927 for the french pechelbronn oil field
for many years the world’s deepest borehole was the kola superdeep borehole from 2011 until august 2012 the record was held by the 12345-metre 40502 ft long sakhalin-i odoptu op-11 well offshore the russian island sakhalin the chayvo z-44 extended-reach well took the title of the world's longest borehole on 27 august 2012 z-44's total measured depth is 12376 m 40604 ft however erd wells are more shallow than kola superdeep borehole owing to a large horizontal displacement
drillers may sink a borehole using a drilling rig or a hand-operated rig the machinery and techniques to advance a borehole vary considerably according to manufacturer geological conditions and the intended purpose for offshore drilling floating units or platforms supported by the seafloor are used for the drilling rig
