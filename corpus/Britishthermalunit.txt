the british thermal unit btu or btu is a traditional unit of work equal to about 1055 joules it is the amount of work needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree fahrenheit physical analogue one four-inch wooden kitchen match consumed completely generates approximately 1 btu in science the joule the si unit of energy has largely replaced the btu
the btuh is most often used as a measure of power in the power steam generation heating and air conditioning industries it is still used in some metric english-speaking countries such as canada but notably not the united kingdom in north america the heat value energy content of fuels is expressed in btus
the notation kbtu or kbtu is often used for thousand btu in sizing of heating systems and in the energy use index eui expressed as thousand btu annual energy use per square foot of building mbtu represents one million btu although the atypical notation mmbtu or mmbtu is sometimes used to represent one million btusee definitions below


a btu is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 avoirdupois pound of liquid water by 1 degree fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one atmosphere as with the calorie several definitions of the btu exist because the temperature response of water to heat energy is non-linear this means that the change in temperature of a water mass caused by adding a certain amount of heat to it will be a function of the water's initial temperature definitions of the btu based on different water temperatures can therefore vary by up to 0.5%
the unit mbtu or mbtu was defined as one thousand btu presumably from the roman numeral system where m or m stands for one thousand 1000 this notation is easily confused with the si mega- m prefix which denotes multiplication by a factor of one million ×106 or with the si milli- m prefix which denotes division by a factor of one thousand ×10−3
to avoid confusion some companies and engineers use the notation mmbtu or mmbtu to represent one million btu although confusingly mm in roman numerals would traditionally represent 2000 and in many contexts this form of notation is deprecated and discouraged in favour of the more modern si prefixes alternatively the term therm may be used to represent 100000 or 105 btu and quad for 1015 btu some companies also use 'btue6' in order to reduce confusion between 103 btu and 106 btu
one btu is approximately
a btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a one-pound weight 778 feet 237 m
when used as a unit of power for heating and cooling systems btu per hour btuh is the correct unit though this is often abbreviated to just btu
the btu should not be confused with the board of trade unit botu which is a much larger quantity of energy 1 kw·h or 3412 btu
the btu is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in btu required to generate 1 kw·h of electrical energy a typical coal-fired power plant works at 10500 btukw·h an efficiency of 32–33%
