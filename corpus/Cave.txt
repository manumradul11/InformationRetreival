a cave or cavern is a hollow place in the ground especially a natural underground space large enough for a human to enter caves form naturally by the weathering of rock and often extend deep underground the word cave can also refer to much smaller openings such as sea caves rock shelters and grottos
speleology is the science of exploration and study of all aspects of caves and the cave environment visiting or exploring caves for recreation may be called caving potholing or spelunking


the formation and development of caves is known as speleogenesis caves are formed by various geologic processes and can be variable sizes these may involve a combination of chemical processes erosion from water tectonic forces microorganisms pressure and atmospheric influences
it is estimated that the maximum depth of a cave cannot be more than 3000 metres 9800 ft due to the pressure of overlying rocks for karst caves the maximum depth is determined on the basis of the lower limit of karst forming processes coinciding with the base of the soluble carbonate rocks
most caves are formed in limestone by dissolution
solutional caves are the most frequently occurring caves and such caves form in rock that is soluble such as limestone but can also form in other rocks including chalk dolomite marble salt and gypsum rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through bedding planes faults joints and comparable features over geological epochs cracks expand to become caves and cave systems
the largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with h2co3 carbonic acid and naturally occurring organic acids the dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as karst characterized by sinkholes and underground drainage limestone caves are often adorned with calcium carbonate formations produced through slow precipitation these include flowstones stalactites stalagmites helictites soda straws and columns these secondary mineral deposits in caves are called speleothems
the portions of a solutional cave that are below the water table or the local level of the groundwater will be flooded
lechuguilla cave in new mexico and nearby carlsbad cavern are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave they were formed by h2s hydrogen sulfide gas rising from below where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes this gas mixes with ground water and forms h2so4 sulfuric acid the acid then dissolves the limestone from below rather than from above by acidic water percolating from the surface
caves formed at the same time as the surrounding rock are called primary caves
lava tubes are formed through volcanic activity and are the most common primary caves as lava flows downhill its surface cools and solidifies hot liquid lava continues to flow under that crust and if most of it flows out a hollow tube remains examples of such caves can be found in the canary islands jeju-do the basaltic plains of eastern idaho and other places kazumura cave near hilo hawaii is a remarkably long and deep lava tube it is 65.6 km long 40.8 mi
lava caves include but are not limited to lava tubes other caves formed through volcanic activity include rift caves lava mold caves open vertical volcanic conduits and inflationary caves
sea caves are found along coasts around the world a special case is littoral caves which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs often these weaknesses are faults but they may also be dykes or bedding-plane contacts some wave-cut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift elsewhere in places such as thailand's phang nga bay solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion sea caves are generally around 5 to 50 metres 16 to 164 ft in length but may exceed 300 metres 980 ft
corrasional or erosional caves are those that form entirely by erosion by flowing streams carrying rocks and other sediments these can form in any type of rock including hard rocks such as granite generally there must be some zone of weakness to guide the water such as a fault or joint a subtype of the erosional cave is the wind or aeolian cave carved by wind-born sediments many caves formed initially by solutional processes often undergo a subsequent phase of erosional or vadose enlargement where active streams or rivers pass through them
glacier caves are formed by melting ice and flowing water within and under glaciers the cavities are influenced by the very slow flow of the ice which tends to collapse the caves again glacier caves are sometimes misidentified as ice caves though this latter term is properly reserved for bedrock caves that contain year-round ice formations
fracture caves are formed when layers of more soluble minerals such as gypsum dissolve out from between layers of less soluble rock these rocks fracture and collapse in blocks of stone
talus caves are formed by the openings among large boulders that have fallen down into a random heap often at the bases of cliffs these unstable deposits are called talus or scree and may be subject to frequent rockfalls and landslides
anchialine caves are caves usually coastal containing a mixture of freshwater and saline water usually sea water they occur in many parts of the world and often contain highly specialized and endemic fauna
caves are found throughout the world but only a small portion of them have been explored and documented by cavers the distribution of documented cave systems is widely skewed toward countries where caving has been popular for many years such as france italy australia the uk the united states etc as a result explored caves are found widely in europe asia north america and oceania but are sparse in south america africa and antarctica
this is a rough generalization as large expanses of north america and asia contain no documented caves whereas areas such as the madagascar dry deciduous forests and parts of brazil contain many documented caves as the world's expanses of soluble bedrock are researched by cavers the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift for example china despite containing around half the world's exposed limestone—more than 1000000 square kilometres 390000 sq mi—has relatively few documented caves
cave-inhabiting animals are often categorized as troglobites cave-limited species troglophiles species that can live their entire lives in caves but also occur in other environments trogloxenes species that use caves but cannot complete their life cycle fully in caves and accidentals animals not in one of the previous categories some authors use separate terminology for aquatic forms for example stygobites stygophiles and stygoxenes
of these animals the troglobites are perhaps the most unusual organisms troglobitic species often show a number of characteristics termed troglomorphic associated with their adaptation to subterranean life these characteristics may include a loss of pigment often resulting in a pale or white coloration a loss of eyes or at least of optical functionality an elongation of appendages and an enhancement of other senses such as the ability to sense vibrations in water aquatic troglobites or stygobites such as the endangered alabama cave shrimp live in bodies of water found in caves and get nutrients from detritus washed into their caves and from the feces of bats and other cave inhabitants other aquatic troglobites include cave fish and cave salamanders such as the olm and the texas blind salamander
cave insects such as oligaphorura formerly archaphorura schoetti are troglophiles reaching 1.7 millimetres 0.067 in in length they have extensive distribution and have been studied fairly widely most specimens are female but a male specimen was collected from st cuthberts swallet in 1969
bats such as the gray bat and mexican free-tailed bat are trogloxenes and are often found in caves they forage outside of the caves some species of cave crickets are classified as trogloxenes because they roost in caves by day and forage above ground at night
because of the fragile nature of the cave ecosystem and the fact that cave regions tend to be isolated from one another caves harbor a number of endangered species such as the tooth cave spider liphistius trapdoor spider and the gray bat
caves are visited by many surface-living animals including humans these are usually relatively short-lived incursions due to the lack of light and sustenance
cave entrances often have typical florae for instance in the eastern temperate united states cave entrances are most frequently and often densely populated by the bulblet fern cystopteris bulbifera
throughout history primitive peoples have made use of caves the earliest human fossils found in caves come from a series of caves near krugersdorp and mokopane in south africa the cave sites of sterkfontein swartkrans kromdraai b drimolen malapa cooper's d gladysvale gondolin and makapansgat have yielded a range of early human species dating back to between three and one million years ago including australopithecus africanus australopithecus sediba and paranthropus robustus however it is not generally thought that these early humans were living in the caves but that they were brought into the caves by carnivores that had killed them
the first early hominid ever found in africa the taung child in 1924 was also thought for many years to come from a cave where it had been deposited after being predated on by an eagle however this is now debated hopley et al 2013 am j phys anthrop caves do form in the dolomite of the ghaap plateau including the early middle and later stone age site of wonderwerk cave however the caves that form along the escarpment's edge like that hypothesised for the taung child are formed within a secondary limestone deposit called tufa there is numerous evidence for other early human species inhabiting caves from at least one million years ago in different parts of the world including homo erectus in china at zhoukoudian homo rhodesiensis in south africa at the cave of hearths makapansgat homo neandertalensis and homo heidelbergensis in europe at archaeological site of atapuerca homo floresiensis in indonesia and the denisovans in southern siberia
in southern africa early modern humans regularly used sea caves as shelter starting about 180000 years ago when they learned to exploit the sea for the first time marean et al 2007 nature the oldest known site is pp13b at pinnacle point this may have allowed rapid expansion of humans out of africa and colonization of areas of the world such as australia by 60-50000 years ago throughout southern africa australia and europe early modern humans used caves and rock shelters as sites for rock art such as those at giants castle caves such as the yaodong in china were used for shelter other caves were used for burials such as rock-cut tombs or as religious sites such as buddhist caves among the known sacred caves are china's cave of a thousand buddhas and the sacred caves of crete
