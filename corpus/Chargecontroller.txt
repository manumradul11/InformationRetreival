a charge controller charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is added to or drawn from electric batteries it prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk it may also prevent completely draining deep discharging a battery or perform controlled discharges depending on the battery technology to protect battery life the terms charge controller or charge regulator may refer to either a stand-alone device or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack battery-powered device or battery charger


charge controllers are sold to consumers as separate devices often in conjunction with solar or wind power generators for uses such as rv boat and off-the-grid home battery storage systems in solar applications charge controllers may also be called solar regulators some charge controllers  solar regulators have additional features such as a low voltage disconnect lvd a separate circuit which powers down the load when the batteries become overly discharged some battery chemistries are such that over-discharge can ruin the battery
a series charge controller or series regulator disables further current flow into batteries when they are full a shunt charge controller or shunt regulator diverts excess electricity to an auxiliary or shunt load such as an electric water heater when batteries are full
simple charge controllers stop charging a battery when they exceed a set high voltage level and re-enable charging when battery voltage drops back below that level pulse width modulation pwm and maximum power point tracker mppt technologies are more electronically sophisticated adjusting charging rates depending on the battery's level to allow charging closer to its maximum capacitycitation needed
a charge controller with mppt capability frees the system designer from closely matching available pv voltage to battery voltage considerable efficiency gains can be achieved particularly when the pv array is located at some distance from the battery by way of example a 150 volt pv array connected to an mppt charge controller can be used to charge a 24 or 48 volt battery higher array voltage means lower array current so the savings in wiring costs can more than pay for the controller
charge controllers may also monitor battery temperature to prevent overheating some charge controller systems also display data transmit data to remote displays and data logging to track electric flow over time
circuitry that functions as a charge regulator controller may consist of several electrical components or may be encapsulated in a single microchip an integrated circuit ic usually called a charge controller ic or charge control ic
charge controller circuits are used for rechargeable electronic devices such as cell phones laptop computers portable audio players and uninterruptible power supplies as well as for larger battery systems found in electric vehicles and orbiting space satellites
