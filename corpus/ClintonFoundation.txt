the clinton foundation encompasses a number of different efforts and entities including the clinton health access initiative chai spun off into a separate but related organization in 2010 the clinton global initiative cgi split off after 2009 but reintegrated after 2013 clinton global initiative university cgi u the clinton climate initiative cci the clinton development initiative cdi the clinton economic opportunity initiative the clinton giustra sustainable growth initiative the clinton health matters initiative chmi the alliance for a healthier generation and the no ceilings project however there is criticism that the foundation has become a tool of the permanent campaign for clinton family's political activities
through 2014 the foundation had raised almost $2 billion from us corporations especially wall street foreign governments and corporations political donors and various other moneyed interests during its lifetime the foundation has received praise from philanthropic experts and has had support from both democrats and republicans with the latter including members of the george w bush administration charitable grants are not a major focus of the clinton foundation which instead keeps most of its money in house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs because of this unusual structure for a foundation charity navigator a charity watchdog has said it does not have a methodology to rate the clinton foundation consequently they added the foundation to their charity watch list in april 2015 it was removed from the watch list in december 2015 after the charity posted amended tax returns and a public memo on its website a different charity monitor the american institute of philanthropy says that 89 percent of the foundation's money goes toward its charitable mission and gave the foundation an a rating for 2013
questions have been raised about the foundation's financial practices about its fundraising from foreign governments and corporations about the transparency of its reporting of its donors and about possible conflicts of interest between donations to the foundation and the actions of hillary clinton when she was us secretary of state during 2009–13 and in connection with her subsequent 2016 presidential campaign see also transparency of clinton foundation
in 2016 media outlets reported that in fall 2015 the united states department of state issued a subpoena to the foundation for records relating to activities by the foundation during hillary clinton's term as secretary of state and for information regarding activities by 2016 clinton campaign vice chairwoman huma abedin


the origins of the foundation go back to 1997 when the president was focused mostly on the future clinton presidential center in little rock arkansas
bill clinton founded the william j clinton foundation in 2001 following the completion of his presidency longtime clinton advisor bruce lindsey became the ceo in 2004 later lindsey moved from being ceo to being chair largely for health reasons other clinton hands who played an important early role included doug band and ira magaziner additional clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include john podesta and laura graham
most of the foundation's successes came from bill clinton's worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives celebrities and government officials similarly the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever bill clinton suddenly felt an interest in
in 2008 a the new york times article reported that a canadian financier frank giustra flew clinton on a luxurious jet to kazakhstan in 2005 as part of a three-country philanthropic tour the article implied that a statement clinton made praising that nation's president nursultan nazarbayev was linked to giustra's uranium company signing preliminary agreements for the right to buy into three uranium projects controlled by the state-owned uranium agency kazatomprom it also reported that in 2006 giustra donated $31 million to the clinton foundation
in 2009 however forbes reported fact-checking the times article and found that flight manifests showed the two arriving in kazakhstan on separate dates the deal was between private enterprises without a need for approval from the government and giustra maintained the deal was settled two weeks before bill clinton's trip
preceding barack obama's 2009 nomination of hillary clinton as us secretary of state bill clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the clinton presidential center and the clinton global initiative accordingly a list of donors was released for the first time in december 2008 the list was large and included politically sensitive donors from the kingdom of saudi arabia to blackwater worldwide the foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that not even the appearance of a conflict of interest would exist once hillary clinton was secretary of state
by 2011 chelsea clinton was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board to raise money for the foundation she gives paid speeches such as her 2014 address at the university of missouri in kansas city for the opening of a women's hall of fame for which she was paid $65000 the university had attempted to book hillary clinton but reconsidered when they discovered her usual fee was $275000 the university then booked chelsea instead with her fee going directly to the clinton foundation a spokesperson for the foundation said in 2015 that unlike her parents' talks ms clinton's speeches are on behalf of the clinton foundation and 100 percent of the fees are remitted directly to the foundation
in 2013 hillary clinton joined the foundation following her tenure as secretary of state she planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and small children as well as economic development accordingly at that point it was renamed the bill hillary & chelsea clinton foundation extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the united states presidential election 2016
in july 2013 eric braverman was named ceo of the foundation he is a friend and former colleague of chelsea clinton from mckinsey & company at the same time chelsea clinton was named vice chair of the foundation's board the foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the time-life building in midtown manhattan
chelsea clinton moved the organization to an outside review conducted by the firm of simpson thacher & bartlett it's conclusions were made public in mid-2013 the main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president's fundraising abilities how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond bill clinton's lifetime dennis cheng a former hillary clinton campaign official and state department deputy chief was named to oversee a $250 million endowment drive the review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities additionally the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation's conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process
in august 2013 the new york times reported on the foundation's recent developments including financial losses staff conflicts and spending excesses in response bill clinton published an open letter saying the deficits described by the paper were misleading and a consequence of the unique accounting and tax reporting requirements placed upon foundations
in january 2015 braverman announced his resignation politico attributed the move to being partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation he was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary maura pally
on february 18 2015 the washington post reported that the foundation has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support with members of the george w bush administration often participating in its programs
in march 2015 former secretary of health and human services in the clinton administration donna shalala was selected to run the clinton foundation going forward
the clinton health access initiative chai was spun off into a separate organization in 2010

the clinton foundation hivaids initiative's work on the ground has been subject of some criticism the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank wrote that governments and organizations in africa and asia that partnered with the foundation expressed caution and alarm at the foundation's focus on treating a large number of patients with less regard for the importance of adherence follow-up and quality of care
