a clothes line or washing line is any type of rope cord or twine that has been stretched between two points eg two sticks outside or indoors above the level of the ground clothing that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry using clothes pegs or clothespins washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall and are frequently located in back gardens or on balconies longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing
more elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape with multiple lines being used such as the hills hoist from australia some can be folded up when not in use although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught so there is usually a safety button
in scotland many tenement buildings have a drying green which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines – it may also be used as a recreational space as well as a clothes horse connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather in scotland a hills hoist is referred to as a whirligig


laundry may be dried indoors rather than outdoors for a variety of reasons including
several types of devices are available for indoor drying a drying rack or clotheshorse can help save space in an apartment or clothes lines can be strung in the basement during the winter small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower curtain pole the drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying because of the lack of direct solar radiation and the convective assistance of the wind
the evaporation of the moisture from the clothes will cool the indoor air and increase the humidity level which may or may not be desirable in cold dry weather moderate increases in humidity make most people feel more comfortable in warm weather increased humidity makes most people feel even hotter increased humidity can also increase growth of fungi which can cause health problems
an average-sized wash load will convert approximately 4965 kilojoules of ambient heat into latent heat that is stored in the evaporated water as follows a typical 4 kg load of laundry can contain 2.2 kg of water after being spun in a laundry machine to determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried the difference is the weight of the water that was evaporated from them multiply that weight in kg by 2257 kjkg which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water or multiply by 0.6250 kwhkg to get kilowatt-hours note if the moisture later condenses inside the house the latent heat will be converted back into ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly  to obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation the process can be traced on a psychrometric chart
there are few factor that determine the duration of drying and can help to decide rather to use drier or clothes line
laundry may be dried outdoors when the temperature is well below the freezing point first the moisture in the laundry items will freeze and the clothing will become stiff then the frost on the clothes will sublimate into the air leaving the items dry it takes a long time and it is usually much quicker to dry them indoors however indoor drying removes heat from the air so it is a trade-off between speed and energy efficiency
a variety of interests are involved in the controversy about clothes lines including frugal living global warming individual rights the economy private property class aesthetics health energy national security and nostalgiaoriginal research?citation needed
when mechanical dryers were first introduced only well-to-do families could afford them and they became associated with affluence however now that most people can afford a mechanical dryer clothes lines have become associated with a home-town character in neighborhoods because they are indicative of a low-crime area outdoor clothes lines may be used less frequently in high-crime areas because of the risk of clothes being stolen – a worldwide phenomenon also environmental concerns and higher energy prices have created a new generation of clothes line advocates still the old association with poverty persists in some people's mindsoriginal research?citation needed
the controversy surrounding the use of clothes lines has prompted many governments to pass right-to-dry laws allowing their use according to ian urbina a reporter for the new york times the majority of the 60 million people who now live in the country’s roughly 300000 private communities are forbidden from using outdoor clothes linesthe clotheslines of cohoes
as of october 2009 the states of florida colorado utah hawaii maine and vermont had passed laws forbidding bans on clothes lines similar bills were under consideration in maryland north carolina oregon and virginia at least eight states restrict homeowners associations from forbidding the installation of solar-energy systems and lawyers have debated whether or not those laws might apply to clothes lines a british filmmaker steven lake is planning to release a documentary in 2011 titled drying for freedom about the clothes-line controversy in the united states
in canada the province of nova scotia's first ndp government passed an act to prevent prohibitions on the use of clotheslines on december 10 2010 to allow all homeowners in the province to use clotheslines regardless of restrictive covenants the province of ontario lifted bans on clothes lines in 2008
some other affluent suburban municipalities such as hampstead québec or outremont québec also prohibit clotheslinescitation needed
