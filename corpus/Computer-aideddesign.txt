computer-aided design cad is the use of computer systems to aid in the creation modification analysis or optimization of a design cad software is used to increase the productivity of the designer improve the quality of design improve communications through documentation and to create a database for manufacturing cad output is often in the form of electronic files for print machining or other manufacturing operations
computer-aided design is used in many fields its use in designing electronic systems is known as electronic design automation or eda in mechanical design it is known as mechanical design automation mda or computer-aided design cad which includes the process of creating a technical drawing with the use of computer software
cad software for mechanical design uses either vector-based graphics to depict the objects of traditional drafting or may also produce raster graphics showing the overall appearance of designed objects however it involves more than just shapes as in the manual drafting of technical and engineering drawings the output of cad must convey information such as materials processes dimensions and tolerances according to application-specific conventions
cad may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional 2d space or curves surfaces and solids in three-dimensional 3d space
cad is an important industrial art extensively used in many applications including automotive shipbuilding and aerospace industries industrial and architectural design prosthetics and many more cad is also widely used to produce computer animation for special effects in movies advertising and technical manuals often called dcc digital content creation the modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by engineers of the 1960s because of its enormous economic importance cad has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry computer graphics both hardware and software and discrete differential geometry
the design of geometric models for object shapes in particular is occasionally called computer-aided geometric design cagd


starting around the mid 1970s as computer aided design systems began to provide more capability than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting the cost benefit for companies to switch to cad became apparent the benefit of cad systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today automated generation of bill of material auto layout in integrated circuits interference checking and many others eventually cad provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations during this transition calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs cad was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry where draftsmen designers and engineering roles begin to merge it did not eliminate departments as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman designers and engineers cad is just another example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry current computer-aided design software packages range from 2d vector-based drafting systems to 3d solid and surface modelers modern cad packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle even from the inside looking out some cad software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling in which case it may be marketed as cad
cad technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings from small residential types houses to the largest commercial and industrial structures hospitals and factories
cad is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3d models andor 2d drawings of physical components but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components it can also be used to design objects furthermore many cad applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs 4d bim is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management
cad has become an especially important technology within the scope of computer-aided technologies with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle cad enables designers to layout and develop work on screen print it out and save it for future editing saving time on their drawings
computer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question
cad is one part of the whole digital product development dpd activity within the product lifecycle management plm processes and as such is used together with other tools which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products such as
cad is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of environmental impact reports in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of cad
cad has been proven to be useful to engineers as well using four properties which are history features parameterization and high level constraints the construction history can be used to look back into the model's personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size shape and other properties of the different modeling elements the features in the cad system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength yield strength electrical or electro-magnetic properties also its stress strain timing or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures etc
there are several different types of cad each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner for each
there are many producers of the lower-end 2d systems including a number of free and open source programs these provide an approach to the drawing process without all the fuss over scale and placement on the drawing sheet that accompanied hand drafting since these can be adjusted as required during the creation of the final draft
3d wireframe is basically an extension of 2d drafting not often used today each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing the final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it such as holes the operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2d systems although many 3d systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views
3d dumb solids are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real world objects not often used today basic three-dimensional geometric forms prisms cylinders spheres and so on have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models basic 3d solids don't usually include tools to easily allow motion of components set limits to their motion or identify interference between components
there are two types of 3d solid modeling
top end systems offer the capabilities to incorporate more organic aesthetics and ergonomic features into designs freeform surface modeling is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine
originally software for computer-aided design systems was developed with computer languages such as fortran algol but with the advancement of object-oriented programming methods this has radically changed typical modern parametric feature based modeler and freeform surface systems are built around a number of key c modules with their own apis a cad system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a graphical user interface gui with nurbs geometry andor boundary representation b-rep data via a geometric modeling kernel a geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly
unexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of prototyping called digital prototyping in contrast to physical prototypes which entail manufacturing time in the design that said cad models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an industrial ct scanning machine depending on the nature of the business digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs
today cad systems exist for all the major platforms windows linux unix and mac os x some packages even support multiple platforms
right now no special hardware is required for most cad software however some cad systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks so a modern graphics card high speed and possibly multiple cpus and large amounts of ram may be recommended
the human-machine interface is generally via a computer mouse but can also be via a pen and digitizing graphics tablet manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a spacemousespaceball some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for viewing the 3d modeltechnologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of usersthese include the cave or hmd`s and interactive devices like motion-sensing technology
designers have long used computers for their calculations digital computers were used in power system analysis or optimization as early as proto-whirlwind in 1949 circuit design theory or power network methodology would be algebraic symbolic and often vector-based examples of problems being solved in the mid-1940s to 50s include servo motors controlled by generated pulse 1949 the digital computer with built-in compute operations to automatically co-ordinate transforms to compute radar related vectors 1951 and the essentially graphic mathematical process of forming a shape with a digital machine tool 1952 these were accomplished with the use of computer software the man credited with coining the term cad douglas t ross stated as soon as i saw the interactive display equipment being used by radar operators 1953 the designers of these very early computers built utility programs so that programmers could debug programs using flow charts on a display scope with logical switches that could be opened and closed during the debugging session they found that they could create electronic symbols and geometric figures to be used to create simple circuit diagrams and flow charts they made the pleasant discovery that an object once drawn could be reproduced at will its orientation linkage  flux mechanical lexical scoping  or scale changed this suggested numerous possibilities to them it took ten years of interdisciplinary development work before sketchpad sitting on evolving math libraries emerged from mit`s labs additional developments were carried out in the 1960s within the aircraft automotive industrial control and electronics industries in the area of 3d surface construction nc programming and design analysis most of it independent of one another and often not publicly published until much later some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by robert issac newton from pawtucket rhode island robert a heinlein in his 1957 novel the door into summer suggested the possibility of a robotic drafting dan however probably the most important work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by pierre bézier paul de casteljau citroen steven anson coons mit ford james ferguson boeing carl de boor gm birkhoff gm and garibedian gm in the 1960s and w gordon gm and r riesenfeld in the 1970s
the invention of the 3d cadcam is attributed to a french engineer pierre bezier arts et métiers paristech renault after his mathematical work concerning surfaces he developed unisurf between 1966 and 1968 to ease the design of parts and tools for the automotive industry then unisurf became the working base for the following generations of cad software
it is argued that a turning point was the development of the sketchpad system at mit by ivan sutherland who later created a graphics technology company with dr david evans the distinctive feature of sketchpad was that it allowed the designer to interact with his computer graphically the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a crt monitor with a light pen effectively it was a prototype of graphical user interface an indispensable feature of modern cad sutherland presented his paper sketchpad a man-machine graphical communication system in 1963 at a joint computer conference having worked on it as his phd thesis paper for a few years quotingfor drawings where motion of the drawing or analysis of a drawn problem is of value to the user sketchpad excels for highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required sketchpad is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile for drawings which merely communicate with shops it is probably better to use conventional paper and pencil over time efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the designers drawings communicate not just with shops but with the shop tool itself this goal would be a long time arriving
the first commercial applications of cad were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries as well as in electronics only large corporations could afford the computers capable of performing the calculations notable company projects were a joint project of gm dr patrick jhanratty and ibm sam matsa  doug ross`s mit apt research assistant to develop a prototype system for design engineers dac-1 design augmented by computer 1964 lockheed projects bell graphic 1 and renault
one of the most influential events in the development of cad was the founding of mcs manufacturing and consulting services inc in 1971 by dr p j hanratty who wrote the system adam automated drafting and machining but more importantly supplied code to companies such as mcdonnell douglas unigraphics computervision cadds calma gerber autotrol and control data
as computers became more affordable the application areas have gradually expanded the development of cad software for personal desktop computers was the impetus for almost universal application in all areas of construction
other key points in the 1960s and 1970s would be the foundation of cad systems united computing intergraph ibm intergraph igds in 1974 which led to bentley systems microstation in 1984
cad implementations have evolved dramatically since then initially with 3d in the 1970s it was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings advances in programming and computer hardware notably solid modeling in the 1980s have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities
key products for 1981 were the solid modelling packages - romulus shapedata and uni-solid unigraphics based on padl-2 and the release of the surface modeler catia dassault systemes autodesk was founded 1982 by john walker which led to the 2d system autocad the next milestone was the release of proengineer in 1987 which heralded greater usage of feature-based modeling methods and parametric linking of the parameters of features also of importance to the development of cad was the development of the b-rep solid modeling kernels engines for manipulating geometrically and topologically consistent 3d objects parasolid shapedata and acis spatial technology inc at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s both inspired by the work of ian braid this led to the release of mid-range packages such as solidworks and trispective later known as ironcad in 1995 solid edge then intergraph in 1996 and autodesk inventor in 1999 an independent geometric modeling kernel has been evolving in russia since the 1990s nikolay golovanov joined ascon company in 1994 from the kolomna engineering design bureau and began development of c3d – the geometric kernel of the russian popular cad system kompas-3d nowadays c3d c3d labs is the most valued russian cad product in the category of components ie products designed for integration in the end-user cad systems of russian and global vendors
the following are open sources products used widelyby whom?
