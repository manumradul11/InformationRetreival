later in elizabethan performance during the 1500-1600s in england costume became the most important visual element garments were very expensive because only the finest fabrics were used the majority of characters were clothed in elizabethan fashion otherwise the costumes could be divided into five categories ancient which was out of style clothing used to represent another period antique older additions to contemporary clothing to distinguish classical characters dreamlike fanciful garments for supernatural or allegorical characters traditional clothing which represented only a few specific people such as robin hood or national or racial costumes that were intended to set apart a specific group of people but did not tend to be historically accurate
ordinarily fashionable garments were used in both comedy and tragedy until 1727 when adrienne lecouvreur adopted the much more elaborate and formal court dress for tragedy her practice soon became standard for all tragic heroines  major actors began to compete with one another as to who would have the most lavish stage dress this practice continued until around the 1750s when costumes became relevant to the character again art began to copy life and realistic characteristics were favored especially during the 19th century for example georg the second duke of saxe-meiningen took personal interest in the theatre and began managing troupes he advocated for authenticity and accuracy of the script and time period therefore he refused to let actors tamper with their own costumes he also made sure the materials were authentic and specific using real chain mail armor swords etc no cheap substitutes would be allowed
in august 1823 in an issue of the album james planché published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of shakespeare's plays especially when it comes to costumes in the same year a casual conversation led to one of planché's more lasting effects on british theatre he observed to charles kemble the manager of covent garden that while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a christmas pantomime or an easter spectacle the plays of shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery and at the best a new dress or two for the principal characters kemble saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town and agreed to give planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of king john if he would carry out the research design the costumes and superintend the production planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as francis douce and sir samuel meyrick the research involved sparked planché's latent antiquarian interests these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life
despite the actors' reservations king john was a success and led to a number of similarly-costumed shakespeare productions by kemble and planché henry iv part i as you like it othello cymbeline julius caesar the designs and renderings of king john henry iv as you like it othello hamlet and merchant of venice were published though there is no evidence that hamlet and merchant of venice were ever produced with planché’s historically accurate costume designs planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes cortez the woman never vext the merchant's wedding charles xii the partisans the brigand chief and hofer after 1830 although he still used period costume he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays his work in king john had brought about a revolution in nineteenth-century stage practice which lasted for almost a century

the costume design process involves many steps and though they differ from genre to genre a basic method is commonly used
1 analysis the first step is an analysis of the script musical composition choreography etc parameters must be established
2 design collaboration an important phase in the process is meeting with the director and fellow designers there must be a clear understanding
3 costume research once guidelines are established the next step is to gather research
