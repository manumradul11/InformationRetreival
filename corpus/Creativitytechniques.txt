creativity techniques are methods that encourage creative actions whether in the arts or sciences they focus on a variety of aspects of creativity including techniques for idea generation and divergent thinking methods of re-framing problems changes in the affective environment and so on they can be used as part of problem solving artistic expression or therapy
some techniques require groups of two or more people while other techniques can be accomplished alone these methods include word games written exercises and different types of improvisation or algorithms for approaching problems aleatory techniques exploiting randomness are also common


aleatoricism is the incorporation of chance random elements into the process of creation especially the creation of art or media aleatoricism is commonly found in music art and literature particularly in poetry in film andy voda made a movie in 1979 called chance chants which he produced by a flip of a coin or roll of a dice in music john cage an avant-garde musician composed music by superimposing star maps on blank sheet music by rolling dice and preparing open ended scores that depended on the spontaneous decisions of the performers 1 other ways of practicing randomness include coin tossing picking something out of a hat or selecting random words from a dictionary
in short aleatoricism is a way to introduce new thoughts or ideas into a creative process
improvisation is a creative process which can be spoken written or composed without prior preparation improvisation also called extemporization can lead to the discovery of new ways to act new patterns of thought and practices or new structures improvisation is used in the creation of music theater and other various forms many artists also use improvisational techniques to help their creative flow
the following are two significant methods
each type of improvisation improves the thinking and acting skills of the actor and this is done by using no practice a similar set of techniques is called alienation since one of its many techniques uses actors that haven't rehearsed or even read the play improvisation is an acting technique during which actors make up a storyline start and end on the spot and try their best to keep in character
in problem-solving contexts the random-word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method a person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem a random image sound or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or provocation
there are many tools and methodologies to support creativity
