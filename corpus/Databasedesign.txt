database design is the process of producing a detailed data model of a database this data model contains all the needed logical and physical design choices and physical storage parameters needed to generate a design in a data definition language which can then be used to create a database a fully attributed data model contains detailed attributes for each entity
the term database design can be used to describe many different parts of the design of an overall database system principally and most correctly it can be thought of as the logical design of the base data structures used to store the data in the relational model these are the tables and views in an object database the entities and relationships map directly to object classes and named relationships however the term database design could also be used to apply to the overall process of designing not just the base data structures but also the forms and queries used as part of the overall database application within the database management system dbms
the process of doing database design generally consists of a number of steps which will be carried out by the database designer usually the designer must
within the relational model the final step above can generally be broken down into two further steps that of determining the grouping of information within the system generally determining what are the basic objects about which information is being stored and then determining the relationships between these groups of information or objects this step is not necessary with an object database


in a majority of cases a person who is doing the design of a database is a person with expertise in the area of database design rather than expertise in the domain from which the data to be stored is drawn eg financial information biological information etc therefore the data to be stored in the database must be determined in cooperation with a person who does have expertise in that domain and who is aware of what data must be stored within the system
this process is one which is generally considered part of requirements analysis and requires skill on the part of the database designer to elicit the needed information from those with the domain knowledge this is because those with the necessary domain knowledge frequently cannot express clearly what their system requirements for the database are as they are unaccustomed to thinking in terms of the discrete data elements which must be stored data to be stored can be determined by requirement specification
once a database designer is aware of the data which is to be stored within the database they must then determine where dependency is within the data sometimes when data is changed you can be changing other data that is not visible for example in a list of names and addresses assuming a situation where multiple people can have the same address but one person cannot have more than one address the address is dependent upon the name when provided a name and the list the address can be uniquely determined however the inverse does not hold - when given an address and the list a name cannot be uniquely determined because multiple people can reside at an address because an address is determined by a name an address is considered dependent on a name
note a common misconception is that the relational model is so called because of the stating of relationships between data elements therein this is not true the relational model is so named because it is based upon the mathematical structures known as relations
once the relationships and dependencies amongst the various pieces of information have been determined it is possible to arrange the data into a logical structure which can then be mapped into the storage objects supported by the database management system in the case of relational databases the storage objects are tables which store data in rows and columns in an object database the storage objects correspond directly to the objects used by the object-oriented programming language used to write the applications that will manage and access the data the relationships may be defined as attributes of the object classes involved or as methods that operate on the object classes
the way this mapping is generally performed is such that each set of related data which depends upon a single object whether real or abstract is placed in a table relationships between these dependent objects is then stored as links between the various objects
each table may represent an implementation of either a logical object or a relationship joining one or more instances of one or more logical objects relationships between tables may then be stored as links connecting child tables with parents since complex logical relationships are themselves tables they will probably have links to more than one parent
database designs also include er entity-relationship model diagrams an er diagram is a diagram that helps to design databases in an efficient way
attributes in er diagrams are usually modeled as an oval with the name of the attribute linked to the entity or relationship that contains the attribute
in the field of relational database design normalization is a systematic way of ensuring that a database structure is suitable for general-purpose querying and free of certain undesirable characteristics—insertion update and deletion —that could lead to loss of data integrity
a standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should create a fully normalized design selective denormalization can subsequently be performed but only for performance reasons however some modeling disciplines such as the dimensional modeling approach to data warehouse design explicitly recommend non-normalized designs ie designs that in large part do not adhere to 3nf normalization consists of normal forms that are 1nf2nf3nfboyce-codd nf 3.5nf4nf and 5nf
schema refinement of the database specifies that the data is normalized to reduce data insufficiency and conflicts
the physical design of the database specifies the physical configuration of the database on the storage media this includes detailed specification of data elements data types indexing options and other parameters residing in the dbms data dictionary it is the detailed design of a system that includes modules & the database's hardware & software specifications of the system
