desalination or desalinization is a process that removes minerals from saline water more generally desalination may also refer to the removal of salts and minerals as in soil desalination which also happens to be a major issue for agricultural production
salt water is desalinated to produce fresh water suitable for human consumption or irrigation one potential by-product of desalination is salt desalination is used on many seagoing ships and submarines most of the modern interest in desalination is focused on developing cost-effective ways of providing fresh water for human use along with recycled wastewater this is one of the few rainfall-independent water sources
due to relatively high energy consumption the costs of desalinating sea water are generally higher than the alternatives fresh water from rivers or groundwater water recycling and water conservation but alternatives are not always available and rapid overdraw and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide additionally there is an environmental cost quoting christopher gasson of global water intelligence at the moment around 1% of the world's population are dependent on desalinated water to meet their daily needs but by 2025 the un expects 14% of the world's population to be encountering water scarcity unless people get radically better at water conservation the desalination industry has a very strong future indeed
desalination is particularly relevant in dry countries such as australia which traditionally have relied on collecting rainfall behind dams to provide their drinking water supplies according to the international desalination association in june 2011 15988 desalination plants operated worldwide producing 66.5 million cubic meters per day providing water for 300 million people this number has been updated to 78.4 million cubic meters by 2013 or 57% greater than just 5 years prior the single largest desalination project is ras al-khair in saudi arabia which produced 1025000 cubic meters per day in 2014 although this plant in saudi arabia is expected to be surpassed by a desal plant in california the largest percent of desalinated water used in any country is in israel which produces 40% of its domestic water use from seawater desalination
the traditional process used in these operations is vacuum distillation—essentially the boiling of water at less than atmospheric pressure and thus a much lower temperature than normal this is because the boiling of a liquid occurs when the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature thus because of the reduced temperature low-temperature waste heat from electrical power generation or industrial processes can be minimizedcitation needed
the principal competing processes use membranes to desalinate principally applying reverse osmosis technology membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and pressure to separate salts from water reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal distillation which has led to a reduction in overall desalination costs over the past decade desalination remains energy intensive however and future costs will continue to depend on the price of both energy and desalination technology
energy consumption of sea water desalination can be as low as 3 kwhm3 including pre-filtering and ancillaries similar to the energy consumption of existing fresh water supplies transported over large distances but much higher than local fresh water supplies which use 0.2 kwhm3 or less
a minimum energy consumption for sea water desalination of around 1 kwhm3 has been determined excluding prefiltering and intakeoutfall pumping under 2 kwhm3 has been achieved with existing reverse osmosis membrane technology leaving limited scope for further energy reductions
supplying all domestic water by sea water desalination would increase the united states' energy consumption by around 10% about the amount of energy used by domestic refrigerators
however domestic consumption is a relatively small fraction of the total water usage in the united states
the table below shows the energy consumption of sea water desalination methods
note electrical equivalent refers to the amount of electrical energy which could be generated using a given quantity of thermal energy and appropriate turbine generator in addition these calculations do not include the energy required to construct or refurbish consumable items used up in the processes
cogeneration is the process of using excess heat from electricity generation for another task in this case the production of potable water from seawater or brackish groundwater in an integrated or dual-purpose facility where a power plant provides the energy for desalination alternatively the facility's energy production may be dedicated to the production of potable water a stand-alone facility or excess energy may be produced and incorporated into the energy grid a true cogeneration facility cogeneration takes various forms and theoretically any form of energy production could be used however the majority of current and planned cogeneration desalination plants use either fossil fuels or nuclear power as their source of energy most plants are located in the middle east or north africa which use their petroleum resources to offset limited water resources the advantage of dual-purpose facilities is they can be more efficient in energy consumption thus making desalination a more viable option for drinking water
in a december 26 2007 opinion column in the atlanta journal-constitution nolan hertel a professor of nuclear and radiological engineering at georgia tech wrote  nuclear reactors can be used  to produce large amounts of potable water the process is already in use in a number of places around the world from india to japan and russia eight nuclear reactors coupled to desalination plants are operating in japan alone nuclear desalination plants could be a source of large amounts of potable water transported by pipelines hundreds of miles inland
additionally the current trend in dual-purpose facilities is hybrid configurations in which the permeate from a reverse osmosis desalination component is mixed with distillate from thermal desalination basically two or more desalination processes are combined along with power production such facilities have already been implemented in saudi arabia at jeddah and yanbu
a typical supercarrier in the us military uses nuclear power to desalinate 400000 us gallons 1500000 l 330000 imp gal of water per day
costs of desalinating sea water infrastructure energy and maintenance are generally higher than the alternatives fresh water from rivers or groundwater water recycling and water conservation but alternatives are not always available achievable costs in 2013 range from us$0.45 to $1.00cubic metre $us2 to 4kgal 1 cubic meter is about 264 gallons however more than half of the total cost of desalination comes directly from energy cost and since energy price is very volatile any calculated cost of desalination is only good based on the energy price at the time of calculation
the cost of untreated fresh water in the developing world can reach us$5cubic metre
factors that determine the costs for desalination include capacity and type of facility location feed water labor energy financing and concentrate disposal desalination stills now control pressure temperature and brine concentrations to optimize efficiency nuclear-powered desalination might be economical on a large scale
while noting costs are falling and generally positive about the technology for affluent areas in proximity to oceans a 2004 study argued desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions but not for places that are poor deep in the interior of a continent or at high elevation unfortunately that includes some of the places with biggest water problems and indeed one needs to lift the water by 2000 m 6600 ft or transport it over more than 1600 km 990 mi to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs thus it may be more economical to transport fresh water from somewhere else than to desalinate it in places far from the sea like new delhi or in high places like mexico city high transport costs would add to the high desalination costs desalinated water is also expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high such as riyadh and harare in many places the dominant cost is desalination not transport the process would therefore be relatively less expensive in places like beijing bangkok zaragoza phoenix and of course coastal cities like tripoli after being desalinated at jubail saudi arabia water is pumped 200 mi 320 km inland through a pipeline to the capital city of riyadh for coastal cities desalination is increasingly viewed as an untapped and unlimited water source
in 2014 the israeli facilities of hadera palmahim ashkelon and sorek were desalinizing water for less than us$0.40 per cubic meter as of 2006 singapore was desalinating water for us$0.49 per cubic meter the city of perth began operating a reverse osmosis seawater desalination plant in 2006 and the western australian government announced a second plant will be built to serve the city's needs a desalination plant is now operating in australia's largest city sydney and the wonthaggi desalination plant was under construction in wonthaggi victoria
the perth desalination plant is powered partially by renewable energy from the emu downs wind farm a wind farm at bungendore in new south wales was purpose-built to generate enough renewable energy to offset the sydney plant's energy use mitigating concerns about harmful greenhouse gas emissions a common argument used against seawater desalination
in december 2007 the south australian government announced it would build a seawater desalination plant for the city of adelaide australia located at port stanvac the desalination plant was to be funded by raising water rates to achieve full cost recovery an online unscientific poll showed nearly 60% of votes cast were in favor of raising water rates to pay for desalination
a january 17 2008 article in the wall street journal stated in november connecticut-based poseidon resources corp won a key regulatory approval to build the $300 million water-desalination plant in carlsbad north of san diego the facility would produce 50000000 us gallons 190000000 l 42000000 imp gal of drinking water per day enough to supply about 100000 homes  improved technology has cut the cost of desalination in half in the past decade making it more competitive  poseidon plans to sell the water for about $950 per acre-foot 1200 cubic meters 42000 cu ft that compares with an average of $700 an acre-foot 1200 m³ that local agencies now pay for water in june 2012 new estimates were released that showed the cost for the desalinated water had risen to $2329 per acre-foot each $1000 per acre-foot works out to $3.06 for 1000 gallons or $.81 per cubic meter
while this regulatory hurdle was met poseidon resources is not able to break ground until the final approval of a mitigation project for the damage done to marine life through the intake pipe is received as required by california law poseidon resources has made progress in carlsbad despite an unsuccessful attempt to complete construction of tampa bay desal a desalination plant in tampa bay fl in 2001 the board of directors of tampa bay water was forced to buy tampa bay desal from poseidon resources in 2001 to prevent a third failure of the project tampa bay water faced five years of engineering problems and operation at 20% capacity to protect marine life so stuck to reverse osmosis filters prior to fully using this facility in 2007
in 2008 a san leandro california company energy recovery inc was desalinating water for $0.46 per cubic meter
while desalinating 1000 us gallons 3800 l 830 imp gal of water can cost as much as $3 the same amount of bottled water costs $7945 purchased individually in half-liter bottles
lastly desalination may provide flexibility or real options to the overall water supply system a point that is highly valuable and critical in motivating the decision of desalination in singapore and other cities
in the united states cooling water intake structures are regulated by the environmental protection agency under section 316b of the clean water act these intake structures can have the same impacts to the environment as desalination facility intakes according to the epa water intake structures cause adverse environmental impact by pulling large numbers of fish and shellfish or their eggs into an industrial system there the organisms may be killed or injured by heat physical stress or chemicals larger organisms may be killed or injured when they are trapped against screens at the front of an intake structure alternative intake types which avoid this environmental impact include beach wells but these require more energy and higher costs while limiting output
the kwinana desalination plant opened in perth in 2007 water there and at queensland's gold coast desalination plant and sydney's kurnell desalination plant is withdrawn at only 0.1 ms 0.33 fts which is slow enough to let fish escape the plant provides nearly 140000 m3 4900000 cu ft of clean water per day
all desalination processes produce large quantities of a concentrate which may be increased in temperature and contain residues of pretreatment and cleaning chemicals their reaction byproducts and heavy metals due to corrosion chemical pretreatment and cleaning are a necessity in most desalination plants which typically includes the treatment against biofouling scaling foaming and corrosion in thermal plants and against biofouling suspended solids and scale deposits in membrane plants
to limit the environmental impact of returning the brine to the ocean it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant while seawater power plant cooling water outfalls are not as fresh as wastewater treatment plant outfalls salinity is reduced with medium to large power plant and desalination plant the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be at least several times larger than that of the desalination plant another method to reduce the increase in salinity is to mix the brine via a diffuser in a mixing zone for example once the pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor it can split into many branches each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution
brine is denser than seawater due to higher solute concentration the ocean bottom is most at risk because the brine sinks and remains there long enough to damage the ecosystem careful reintroduction can minimize this problem for example for the desalination plant and ocean outlet structures to be built in sydney from late 2007 the water authority stated the ocean outlets would be placed in locations at the seabed that will maximize the dispersal of the concentrated seawater such that it will be indistinguishable beyond between 50 and 75 meters 164 and 246 ft from the outlets typical oceanographic conditions off the coast allow for rapid dilution of the concentrated byproduct thereby minimizing harm to the environment
some methods of desalination particularly in combination with evaporation ponds solar stills and condensation trap solar desalination do not discharge brine they do not use chemicals in their processes nor the burning of fossil fuels they do not work with membranes or other critical parts such as components that include heavy metals thus do not cause toxic waste and high maintenance
a new approach that works like a solar still but on the scale of industrial evaporation ponds is the integrated biotectural system it can be considered full desalination because it converts the entire amount of saltwater intake into distilled water one of the unique advantages of this type of solar-powered desalination is the feasibility for inland operation standard advantages also include no air pollution from desalination power plants and no temperature increase of endangered natural water bodies from power plant cooling-water discharge another important advantage is the production of sea salt for industrial and other uses currently 50% of the world's sea salt production still relies on fossil energy sources
increased water conservation and efficiency remain the most cost-effective priorities in areas of the world where there is a large potential to improve the efficiency of water use practices wastewater reclamation for irrigation and industrial use provides multiple benefits over desalination urban runoff and storm water capture also provide benefits in treating restoring and recharging groundwater
a proposed alternative to desalination in the american southwest is the commercial importation of bulk water from water-rich areas either by very large crude carriers converted to water carriers or via pipelines the idea is politically unpopular in canada where governments imposed trade barriers to bulk water exports as a result of a claim filed in 1999 under chapter 11 of the north american free trade agreement nafta by sun belt water inc a company established in 1990 in santa barbara california to address pressing local needs due to a severe drought in that area
israeli researchers have found possible link between seawater desalination and iodine deficiency their study conducted by yaniv ovadia registered dietitian following the supervision of dr dov gefel and dr aron m troen from the barzilai medical center ashkelon and the hebrew university jerusalem revealed prevalent apparent iodine deficiency among euthyroid adults exposed to iodine-poor water simultaneously with supply of an ever-increasing seawater reverse osmosis swro proportion of their area's drinking water these researchers underscored the need for reliable data on iodine intake and status to illuminate the implications of swro desalination on health for populations in regions that are increasingly dependent on desalinated-water
many desalination techniques have been researched with varying degrees of success
diesel generators are commonly used to provide electricity in remote areas they typically produce about 40%–50% of the energy as low-grade heat which leaves the engine via the exhaust by connecting a membrane distillation system to the diesel engine exhaust it is possible to use this low-grade heat which is currently wasted furthermore the membrane distillation system actively cools the diesel generator improving its efficiency and hence increasing its electricity output this results in an energy-neutral desalination solution an example of such a desalination plant was commissioned by dutch company aquaver in march 2014 in the island of gulhi maldives
originally stemming from ocean thermal energy conversion research low-temperature thermal desalination lttd takes advantage of water boiling at low pressures potentially even at ambient temperature the system uses vacuum pumps to create a low-pressure low-temperature environment in which water boils at a temperature gradient of 8–10 °c 46–50 °f between two volumes of water cooling ocean water is supplied from depths of up to 600 m 2000 ft this cold water is pumped through coils to condense the water vapor the resulting condensate is purified water lttd may also take advantage of the temperature gradient available at power plants where large quantities of warm wastewater are discharged from the plant reducing the energy input needed to create a temperature gradient
experiments were conducted in the us and japan to test the approach in japan a spray-ﬂash evaporation system was tested by saga university in hawaii the national energy laboratory tested an open-cycle otec plant with fresh water and power production using a temperature difference of 20 c° between surface water and water at a depth of around 500 m 1600 ft lttd was studied by india's national institute of ocean technology niot from 2004 their first lttd plant opened in 2005 at kavaratti in the lakshadweep islands the plant's capacity is 100000 l 22000 imp gal 26000 us galday at a capital cost of inr 50 million €922000 the plant uses deep water at a temperature of 10 to 12 °c 50 to 54 °f in 2007 niot opened an experimental floating lttd plant off the coast of chennai with a capacity of 1000000 l 220000 imp gal 260000 us galday a smaller plant was established in 2009 at the north chennai thermal power station to prove the lttd application where power plant cooling water is available

the passarell process uses reduced atmospheric pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination the pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor the compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced pressure in the evaporation chamber the compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister removing residual impurities causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber the compression of the vapor causes its temperature to increase the heat generated is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes causing the water in the tubes to vaporize water vapor condenses on the outside of the tubes as product water by combining several physical processes passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its subprocesses namely evaporation demisting vapor compression condensation and water movement within the system
