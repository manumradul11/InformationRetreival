the design and industries association is a united kingdom charity whose object is to engage with all those who share a common interest in the contribution that design can make to the delivery of goods and services that are sustainable and enhance the quality of life for communities and the individual


shortly before the great war there was a growing awareness among british designers of the extent to which german industrial design had taken the ideals of the arts and crafts movement that had originated with william morris and others in britain in the late 19th century and had successfully moved these into the age of mass mechanised production the german deutscher werkbund organisation's cologne exhibition held before the outbreak of war in 1914 had been visited by many of those designers architects retailers and industrialists who were later to found the design and industries association
in march 1915 an exhibition of german manufactures was held at goldsmiths' hall in london shortly afterwards a meeting under the chairmanship of lord aberconway led to the foundation of the design and industries association dia with the express intention of raising the standard of british industrial design under the slogan of fitness for purpose
dia promoted its ideals through lectures journals and exhibitions exhibitions included
the journals published varied through the period and included
in its early years there was considerable tension between the attachment of some members to the principals of the arts and crafts movement and the desire to promote the clearly 20th-century outlook of the modern movement
having been heavily involved with the british government's utility scheme in the second world war dia had campaigned for the greater involvement of government in the promotion of good design ironically dia itself was to be somewhat eclipsed by the foundation of the government funded council for industrial design now the design council in 1944
despite the predominance of the design council in the latter half of the 20th century dia continues its work today as an independent body organising competitions events and offering bursaries
dia office bearers and members have included some of the most notable 20th-century british designers and manufacturers
