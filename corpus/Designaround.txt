in the field of patents the phrase to design around means to invent an alternative to a patented invention that does not infringe the patentâ€™s claims the phrase can also refer to the invention itself
design-arounds are considered to be one of the benefits of patent law by providing monopoly rights to inventors in exchange for disclosing how to make and use their inventions others are given both the information and incentive to invent competitive alternatives that design around the original patent in the field of vaccines for example design-arounds are considered fairly easy it is often possible to use the original patent as a guide for developing an alternative that does not infringe the original patent
design-arounds can be a defense against patent trolls the amount of license fee that a patent troll can demand is limited by the alternative of the cost of designing around the troll's patents
in order to defend against design-arounds inventors often develop a large portfolio of interlocking patents sometimes called a patent thicket thus a competitor will have to design around a large number of patents
