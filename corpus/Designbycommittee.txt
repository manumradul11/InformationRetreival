design by committee is a disparaging term for a project that has many designers involved but no unifying plan or vision


the term is used to refer to suboptimal traits that such a process may produce as a result of having to compromise between the requirements and viewpoints of the participants particularly in the presence of poor leadership or poor technical knowledge such as needless complexity internal inconsistency logical flaws banality and the lack of a unifying vision this democratic design process is in contrast to autocratic design or design by dictator where the project leader decides on the design the difference is that in an autocratic style members of the organizations are not included and the final outcome is the responsibility of the leader design by dictator is the best style to use in an emergency when an immediate decision is needed
the term is especially common in technical parlance it legitimizes the need and general acceptance of a unique systems architect and stresses the need for technical quality over political feasibility
the term is commonly used in information and communications technology especially when referring to the design of languages and technical standards as demonstrated by usenet archives
an example of a technical decision said to be a typical result of design by committee is the asynchronous transfer mode atm cell size of 53 bytes the choice of 53 bytes was political rather than technical when the ccitt was standardizing atm parties from the united states wanted a 64-byte payload parties from europe wanted 32-byte payloads most of the european parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the americans but france and a few others held out for a shorter cell length of 32 bytes a 53-byte size 48 bytes plus 5 byte header was the compromise chosen
the term is also common in other fields of design such as graphic design architecture or industrial design in automotive design this process is often blamed for unpopular or poorly designed cars
one maxim is that a camel is a horse designed by committee this has been attributed to vogue magazine july 1958 to sir alec issigonis and also to university of wisconsin philosophy professor lester hunt
