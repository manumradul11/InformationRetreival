design flows are the explicit combination of electronic design automation tools to accomplish the design of an integrated circuit moore's law has driven the entire ic implementation rtl to gdsii design flowsclarification needed from one which uses primarily stand-alone synthesis placement and routing algorithms to an integrated construction and analysis flows for design closure the challenges of rising interconnect delay led to a new way of thinking about and integrating design closure tools
the rtl to gdsii flow underwent significant changes from 1980 through 2005 the continued scaling of cmos technologies significantly changed the objectives of the various design steps the lack of good predictors for delay has led to significant changes in recent design flows new scaling challenges such as leakage power variability and reliability will continue to require significant changes to the design closure process in the future many factors describe what drove the design flow from a set of separate design steps to a fully integrated approach and what further changes are coming to address the latest challenges in his keynote at the 40th design automation conference entitled the tides of eda alberto sangiovanni-vincentelli distinguished three periods of eda
