design for all in the context of information and communications technology is the conscious and systematic effort to proactively apply principles methods and tools to promote universal design in computer-related technologies including internet-based technologies thus avoiding the need for a posteriori adaptations or specialised design stephanidis et al 2001
design for all is design for human diversity social inclusion and equality eidd stockholm declaration 2004 it should not be conceived of as an effort to advance a single solution for everybody but as a user-centred approach to providing products that can automatically address the possible range of human abilities skills requirements and preferences consequently the outcome of the design process is not intended to be a singular design but a design space populated with appropriate alternatives together with the rationale underlying each alternative that is the specific user and usage context characteristics for which each alternative has been designed
traditionally accessibility problems have been solved with adaptations and the use of assistive technology products has been a technical approach two obtain adaptations universal access implies the accessibility and usability of information and telecommunications technologies by anyone at any place and at any time and their inclusion in any living context it aims to enable equitable access and active participation of potentially all people in existing and emerging computer-mediated human activities by developing universally accessible and usable products and services and suitable support functionalities in the environment these products and services must be capable of accommodating individual user requirements in different contexts of use independent of location target machine or runtime environment therefore the approach aiming to grant the use of equipment or services is generalized seeking to give access to the information society as such citizens are supposed to live in environments populated with intelligent objects where the tasks to be performed and the way of performing them are completely redefined involving a combination of activities of access to information interpersonal communication and environmental control citizens must be given the possibility of carrying them out easily and pleasantly
for a thorough discussion of the challenges and benefits of design for all in the context of ict today see also the edean white paper 2005 and the report on the impact of technological developments on eaccessibility of the dfa@einclusion project


the european commission communication on e-accessibility identified a core of practical challenges as well as market legal and policy issues towards improving eaccessibility and e-inclusion in europe and elaborated a three-fold approach based on
in that respect the challenges that need to be addressed include
the present policy context of accessibility in the information society in europe is the i2010 initiative the i2010 – a european information society for growth and employment initiative was launched by the european commission as a framework for addressing the main challenges and developments in the information society and media sectors up to 2010 it promotes an open and competitive digital economy and emphasises ict as a driver of inclusion and quality of life the initiative contains a range of eu policy instruments to encourage the development of the digital economy such as regulatory instruments research and partnerships with stakeholders
the goal of the european union disability strategy is a society that is open and accessible to all the barriers need to be identified and removed the european union disability strategy has three main focuses co-operation between the commission and the member states full participation of people with disabilities and mainstreaming disability in policy formulation non-discrimination is also one of the general principles of the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities adopted by the united nations general assembly on 13 december 2006 and was opened for signatures on 30 march 2007
there is a long tradition of european legislation with regard to telecommunications in 2002 the european union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services covering all forms of fixed and wireless telecoms data transmission and broadcasting from a design for all perspective the most important directives are the directive on a common regulatory framework and the directive on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services universal service directive
public procurement is an important economic force and therefore it is an important tool to promote accessibility the legislative package of public procurement directives approved in 2004 by the european parliament and the eu's council of ministers will help simplify and modernize procurement procedures
the new directives make it possible to take accessibility needs into account at several stages of a procurement process it is obvious that it is most convenient to refer to standards when making technical specifications there are already many cen etsi and itu standards which can be used for this purpose and many sources which can be useful in practice likewise guidelines like the wai guidelines for example or national guidelines have been used in the future it will be easier to find suitable standards mandate m376 has been given by the european commission to the european standardisation organisations cen cenelec and etsi to come up with a solution for common requirements and conformance assessment
not all products are accessible for persons with disabilities when producing audio books or certain other accessible works an additional copy is created and copyright can be a problem in this situation on the other hand copyright is an essential part of the sustainability of a creative society this conflict of interests must be solved somehow in order to ensure the information society is a society for all there is international and european legislation in this field the objectives of the directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society are to adapt legislation on copyright and related rights to reflect technological developments and to transpose into community law the main international obligations arising from the two treaties on copyright and related rights adopted within the framework of the world intellectual property organisation wipo in december 1996
the relationship between design and privacy is not necessarily obvious modern technology which is a result of design is able to collect significant amounts of personal information the user has an interest in that information being correct and in it being used appropriately the person may want to keep something confidential and have access to the information that has been collected in other words privacy is desired in 1995 the european union adopted a directive on the processing of personal data
this directive established the basic principles for the collection storage and use of personal data which should be respected by governments businesses and any other organizations or individuals engaged in handling personal data within the context of design for all in ict privacy protection is called privacy by design
in the us australia japan and in the european union more and more legislative actions are put in place to require public bodies and companies to make sure that their products and services are accessible and usable not only by standard users but also by others such as elderly persons or people with an impairment as it would be unwise to write down technical – and therefore time-bound – requirements into a law legislative texts preferably refer to international standards
standardisation ie in very general terms producing a standard french norme standard german norm spanish norma is a voluntary action set up in the past almost uniquely by commercial partners who believe that the standardisation will permit easier exchanges of products and goods this implied very often that the acceptance of the standards is also voluntary and triggered by expected commercial benefits only to a very limited extent consumer representatives did participate in standardisation on the other hand laws in many countries are referring more and more to the required acceptance of several standards eg on safety or on ecological aspects the net result of this need for standards is that nowadays many standardisation initiatives are stimulated = subsidised by public bodies or in europe directly and indirectly by the european commission also many guidelines have been created by stakeholder groups
as dfa standardisation was explicitly mentioned in the eeurope2002 and i2010 action plans of the european union several new actions were established since then four major recent strategies can be distinguished
etsi guide human factors hf guidelines for ict products and services design for all
the web content accessibility guidelines wcag 2.0 is a technical standard that covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities including blindness and low vision deafness and hearing loss learning disabilities cognitive limitations limited movement speech disabilities photosensitivity and combinations of these following these guidelines will also often make your web content more usable to users in general
bs 88782010 web accessibility - code of practice provides guidance on how to embed accessibility concerns into organisation's policies and digital production processes the standard provides non-technical website owners a better understanding of the value of inclusive design and a framework for how to use guidelines like wcag 2.0 to help them create products which are designed for all the standard's lead-author jonathan hassell has created a summary of bs 8878 to help organisations better understand how the standard can help them
the application domains of design for all in the context of ict practically include every field involving information and communication technologies
the significance of the application domains reflects their role in establishing a coherent and socially acceptable information society but also the diverse range of human activities affected the critical application domains for design for all can be summarised as follows
the white paper toward an information society for all an international r&d agenda 1998 published by the international scientific forum towards an information society for all isf-is4all has discussed the significance of these application domains
life-long learning is a critical area where emphasis should be placed in the knowledge society of the future it entails a continuous engagement in the acquisition of knowledge and skills to facilitate and sustain equitable participation in the information society new technologies may play a catalytic role in providing new educational mechanisms and structures thus allowing learning to become an inseparable part of life-long human activities in the context of knowledge-intensive learning communities and social interaction amongst groups of people
another important application area and a critical short-term target is the development of general purpose public information systems terminals and information appliances eg information kiosks for access to community-wide information services these are expected to be used in increasingly different contexts including public places homes classrooms etc and provide the means for ubiquitous and nomadic access environmental control will also become increasingly important smart environments will progressively penetrate a wide range of human activities in hospitals hotels public administration buildings etc teleoperation of such environments will also gain increasing attention to facilitate responsiveness to unforeseen events enhanced mobility and security
finally a broad range of transaction services eg banking advertising entertainment social services for the citizens eg administration health care education transport and electronic commerce applications will become increasingly important in reshaping business and residential human activities  security privacy and control are central themes in the evolution of a socially acceptable information society and should receive immediate attention at the same time they will increasingly constitute more complex targets to accomplish as they span across different levels of the telecommunications infrastructure from network services to application services such as business transactions and entertainment terminals and information appliances
one major lever to improve awareness and practice in design for all is the development of education and training programs professionals are needed who have acquired comprehensive specialist knowledge and skills in design for all in addition those professionals who currently work in ict industry need to acquire additional knowledge and skills concerning design for all
little evidence can be found of university degree programmes that specialize in design for all or universal design or that explicitly includes a module about this this lack was tackled in the project dfa@einclusion which devised curricula
the implementation of such programmes is already under way in a few places for example at oslo and akershus university college of applied sciences the middlesex university uk university of linz austria and the university of trás-os-montes e alto douro portugal core topics include an understanding of the principles of human rights the development of standards regulations and legislation the design and development of assistive technologies as well as improved access of mainstream products and services
web accessibility is an important component of accessing the information society and information and guidance is offered by the world wide web consortium's web accessibility initiative wai as well as online tutorials for example opera's web standards curriculum
the complementary approach of training for professionals in ict industry has also been tackled by the dfa@einclusion project a comprehensive curriculum for such trainings has been recommended and is currently subject to a cen workshop negotiation the cen workshop curriculum for training professionals in universal design ud-prof has been implemented in may 2009 following the general rules for cen workshops it offers all interested stakeholders an opportunity to discuss and improve this dfa curriculum for ict professionals
the european design for all e-accessibility network - edean is a network of 160 organisations in european union member states the goal of the network is to support all citizens' access to the information society edean provides
the network is coordinated by the edean secretariat which rotates annually and the corresponding national contact centres which are the contact points for edean in each eu member state
eidd - design for all europe is a 100% self-financed european organisation that covers the entire area of theory and practice of design for all from the built environment and tangible products to communication service and system design originally set up in 1993 as the european institute for design and disability eiddto enhance the quality of life through design for all it changed its name in 2006 to bring it into line with its core business eidd - design for all europe disseminates the application of design for all to business and administration communities previously unaware of its benefits and currently 2009 has active member organisations in 22 european countries the aim of eidd is to encourage active interaction and communication between professionals interested in the theory and practice of design for all and to build bridges between on the one hand these and other members of the design community and on the other hand all those other communities where design for all can make a real difference to the quality of life for everyone
this is a support project to edean the project aims to develop an exemplary training course for design for all targeted to the industry course structures and curricula for studying design for all in undergraduate and postgraduate levels as well as an online knowledge base on design for all
