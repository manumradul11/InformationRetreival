design for excellence design for excellence or design for excellence dfx or dfx are terms and expansions used interchangeably in the existing literature  where the x in design for x is a variable which can have one of many possible values in many fields eg very-large-scale integration vlsi and nanoelectronics x may represent several traits or features including manufacturability power variability cost yield or reliability this gives rise to the terms design for manufacturability dfm dfm design for variability dfv design for cost dfc similarly other disciplines may associate other traits attributes or objectives for x
under the label design for x a wide set of specific design guidelines are summarized each design guideline addresses a given issue that is caused by or affects the traits of a product the design guidelines usually propose an approach and corresponding methods that may help to generate and apply technical knowledge to control improve or even invent particular traits of a product from a knowledge-based view the design guideline represents an explicit form of knowledge that contains information about knowing-how-to see procedural knowledge however two problems are prevalent first this explicit knowledge ie the design guidelines were transformed from a tacit form of knowledge ie by experienced engineers or other specialists thus it is not granted that a freshman or someone who is outside of the subject area will comprehend this generated explicit knowledge this is because it still contains embedded fractions of knowledge or respectively include non-obvious assumptions also called context-dependency see eg doz and santos 199716-18 second the traits of a product are likely to exceed the knowledge base of one human there exists a wide range of specialized fields of engineering and considering the whole life cycle of a product will require non-engineering expertise for this purpose examples of design guidelines are listed in the following


dfx methodologies address different issues that may occur in one or more phase of a product life cycle
each phase is explained with two dichotomous categories of tangible products to show differences in prioritizing design issues in certain product life cycle phases
non-durables that are consumed physically when used eg chocolate or lubricants are not discussed there also exist a wide range of other classifications because products are either a goods b service or c both see oecd and eurostat 200548 thus one can also refer to whole product augmented product or extended product also the business unit strategy of a firm are ignored even though it significantly influences priority-setting in design
design to cost and design to standards serves cost reduction in production operations or respectively supply chain operations except for luxury goods or brands eg swarovski crystals haute couture fashion etc most goods even upper-class goods rely on cost reduction if these are mass produced the same is valid for the functional production strategy of mass customization through engineering design physical interfaces between a parts or components or assemblies of the product and b the manufacturing equipment and the logistical material flow systems can be changed and thus cost reducing effects in operating the latter may be achieved
user focused design guidelines may be associated with consumer durables and after-sales focused design guidelines may be more important for capital goods however in case of capital goods design for ergonomics is needed to ensure clarity simplicity and safety between the human-machine interface the intent is to avoid shop-accidents as well as to ensure efficient work flows also design for aesthetics has become more and more important for capital goods in recent years in business-to-business b2b markets capital goods are usually ordered or respectively business transaction are initiated at industrial trade fairs the functional traits of capital goods in technical terms are assumed generally as fulfilled across all exhibiting competitors therefore a purchaser may be subliminally influenced by the aesthetics of a capital good when it comes to a purchasing decision for consumer durables the aspect of after sales highly depends on the business unit's strategy in terms of service offerings therefore generally statements are not possible to formulate
several other concepts in product evelopment and new product development are very closely related
looking at all life stages of a product product life cycle engineering is essential for design for x otherwise the x may be suboptimized or make no sense when asking what competencies are required for analysing situations that may occur along the life of a product it becomes clear that several departmental functions are required an historical assumption is that new product development is conducted in a departmental-stage process that can be traced back to the classical theory of the firm eg max weber's bureaucracy or henri fayol's administration principles ie new product development activities are closely associated with certain department of a firm at the start of the 1990s the concept of concurrent engineering gained popularity to overcome dysfunctions of departmental stage processes concurrent engineering postulates that several departments must work closely together for certain new product development activities see clark and fujimoto 1991 the logical consequence was the emergence of the organisational mechanism of cross-functional teams for example filippini et al 2005 found evidence that overlapping product development processes only accelerate new product development projects if these are executed by a cross-functional team vice versa
