the design of experiments doe dox or experimental design is the design of any task that aims to describe or explain the variation of information under conditions that are hypothesized to reflect the variation the term is generally associated with true experiments in which the design introduces conditions that directly affect the variation but may also refer to the design of quasi-experiments in which natural conditions that influence the variation are selected for observation
in its simplest form an experiment aims at predicting the outcome by introducing a change of the preconditions which is reflected in a variable called the predictor the change in the predictor is generally hypothesized to result in a change in the second variable hence called the outcome variable experimental design involves not only the selection of suitable predictors and outcomes but planning the delivery of the experiment under statistically optimal conditions given the constraints of available resources
main concerns in experimental design include the establishment of validity reliability and replicability for example these concerns can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the predictor reducing the risk of measurement error and ensuring that the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed related concerns include achieving appropriate levels of statistical power and sensitivity
correctly designed experiments advance knowledge in the natural and social sciences and engineering other applications include marketing and policy making


in 1747 while serving as surgeon on hms salisbury james lind carried out a systematic clinical trial to compare remedies for scurvy this systematic clinical trial constitutes a type of doecitation neededdubious – discuss
lind selected 12 men from the ship all suffering from scurvy lind limited his subjects to men who were as similar as i could have them that is he provided strict entry requirements to reduce extraneous variation he divided them into six pairs giving each pair different supplements to their basic diet for two weeks the treatments were all remedies that had been proposed
the citrus treatment stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered apart from that only group one cider showed some effect of its treatment the remainder of the crew presumably served as a control but lind did not report results from any control untreated group
a theory of statistical inference was developed by charles s peirce in illustrations of the logic of science 1877–1878 and a theory of probable inference 1883 two publications that emphasized the importance of randomization-based inference in statistics
charles s peirce randomly assigned volunteers to a blinded repeated-measures design to evaluate their ability to discriminate weights peirce's experiment inspired other researchers in psychology and education which developed a research tradition of randomized experiments in laboratories and specialized textbooks in the 1800s
charles s peirce also contributed the first english-language publication on an optimal design for regression models in 1876 a pioneering optimal design for polynomial regression was suggested by gergonne in 1815 in 1918 kirstine smith published optimal designs for polynomials of degree six and less
the use of a sequence of experiments where the design of each may depend on the results of previous experiments including the possible decision to stop experimenting is within the scope of sequential analysis a field that was pioneered by abraham wald in the context of sequential tests of statistical hypotheses herman chernoff wrote an overview of optimal sequential designs while adaptive designs have been surveyed by s zacks one specific type of sequential design is the two-armed bandit generalized to the multi-armed bandit on which early work was done by herbert robbins in 1952
a methodology for designing experiments was proposed by ronald fisher in his innovative books the arrangement of field experiments 1926 and the design of experiments 1935 much of his pioneering work dealt with agricultural applications of statistical methods as a mundane example he described how to test the lady tasting tea hypothesis that a certain lady could distinguish by flavour alone whether the milk or the tea was first placed in the cup these methods have been broadly adapted in the physical and social sciences are still used in agricultural engineering and differ from the design and analysis of computer experiments
this example is attributed to harold hotelling it conveys some of the flavor of those aspects of the subject that involve combinatorial designs
weights of eight objects are measured using a pan balance and set of standard weights each weighing measures the weight difference between objects in the left pan vs any objects in the right pan by adding calibrated weights to the lighter pan until the balance is in equilibrium each measurement has a random error the average error is zero the standard deviations of the probability distribution of the errors is the same number σ on different weighings and errors on different weighings are independent denote the true weights by
we consider two different experiments
the question of design of experiments is which experiment is better?
the variance of the estimate x1 of θ1 is σ2 if we use the first experiment but if we use the second experiment the variance of the estimate given above is σ28 thus the second experiment gives us 8 times as much precision for the estimate of a single item and estimates all items simultaneously with the same precision what the second experiment achieves with eight would require 64 weighings if the items are weighed separately however note that the estimates for the items obtained in the second experiment have errors that correlate with each other
many problems of the design of experiments involve combinatorial designs as in this example and others
false positive conclusions often resulting from the pressure to publish or the author's own confirmation bias are an inherent hazard in many fields a good way to prevent biases potentially leading to false positives in the data collection phase is to use a double-blind design when a double-blind design is used participants are randomly assigned to experimental groups but the researcher is unaware of what participants belong to which group therefore the researcher can not affect the participants' response to the intervention experimental designs with undisclosed degrees of freedom are a problem this can lead to conscious or unconscious p-hacking trying multiple things until you get the desired result it typically involves the manipulation - perhaps unconsciously - of the process of statistical analysis and the degrees of freedom until they return a figure below the p<.05 level of statistical significance so the design of the experiment should include a clear statement proposing the analyses to be undertaken p-hacking can be prevented by preregistering researches in which researchers have to send their data analysis plan to the journal they wish to publish their paper in before they even start their data collection so no data mining is possible httpsosfio another way to prevent this is taking the double-blind design to the data-analysis phase where the data are sent to a data-analyst unrelated to the research who scrambles up the data so there is no way to know which participants belong to before they are potentially taken away as outliers
clear and complete documentation of the experimental methodology is also important in order to support replication of results
an experimental design or randomized clinical trial requires careful consideration of several factors before actually doing the experiment an experimental design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment some of the following topics have already been discussed in the principles of experimental design section
the independent variable of a study often has many levels or different groups in a true experiment researchers can have an experimental group which is where their intervention testing the hypothesis is implemented and a control group which has all the same element as the experimental group without the interventional element thus when everything else except for one intervention is held constant researchers can certify with some certainty that this one element is what caused the observed change in some instances having a control group is not ethical this is sometimes solved using two different experimental groups in some cases independent variables are not manipulable for example when testing the difference between two groups who have a different disease or testing the difference between genders obviously variables that would be hard or unethical to assign participants to in these cases a quasi-experimental design may be used
in the pure experimental design the independent predictor variable is manipulated by the researcher - that is - every participant of the research is chosen randomly from the population and each participant chosen is assigned randomly to conditions of the independent variable only when this is done is it possible to certify with high probability that the reason for the differences in the outcome variables are caused by the different conditions therefore researchers should choose the experimental design over other design types whenever possible however the nature of the independent variable does not always allow for manipulation in those cases researchers must be aware of not certifying about causal attribution when their design doesn't allow for it for example in observational designs participants are not assigned randomly to conditions and so if there are differences found in outcome variables between conditions it is likely that there is something other than the differences between the conditions that causes the differences in outcomes that is - a third variable the same goes for studies with correlational design adér & mellenbergh 2008
it is best that a process be in reasonable statistical control prior to conducting designed experiments when this is not possible proper blocking replication and randomization allow for the careful conduct of designed experiments to control for nuisance variables researchers institute control checks as additional measures investigators should ensure that uncontrolled influences eg source credibility perception do not skew the findings of the study a manipulation check is one example of a control check manipulation checks allow investigators to isolate the chief variables to strengthen support that these variables are operating as planned
one of the most important requirements of experimental research designs is the necessity of eliminating the effects of spurious intervening and antecedent variables in the most basic model cause x leads to effect y but there could be a third variable z that influences y and x might not be the true cause at all z is said to be a spurious variable and must be controlled for the same is true for intervening variables a variable in between the supposed cause x and the effect y and anteceding variables a variable prior to the supposed cause x that is the true cause when a third variable is involved and has not been controlled for the relation is said to be a zero orderdisambiguation needed relationship in most practical applications of experimental research designs there are several causes x1 x2 x3 in most designs only one of these causes is manipulated at a time
some efficient designs for estimating several main effects were found independently and in near succession by raj chandra bose and k kishen in 1940 at the indian statistical institute but remained little known until the plackett-burman designs were published in biometrika in 1946 about the same time c r rao introduced the concepts of orthogonal arrays as experimental designs this concept played a central role in the development of taguchi methods by genichi taguchi which took place during his visit to indian statistical institute in early 1950s his methods were successfully applied and adopted by japanese and indian industries and subsequently were also embraced by us industry albeit with some reservations
in 1950 gertrude mary cox and william gemmell cochran published the book experimental designs which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards
developments of the theory of linear models have encompassed and surpassed the cases that concerned early writers today the theory rests on advanced topics in linear algebra algebra and combinatorics
as with other branches of statistics experimental design is pursued using both frequentist and bayesian approaches in evaluating statistical procedures like experimental designs frequentist statistics studies the sampling distribution while bayesian statistics updates a probability distribution on the parameter space

laws and ethical considerations preclude some carefully designed experiments with human subjects legal constraints are dependent on jurisdiction constraints may involve institutional review boards informed consent and confidentiality affecting both clinical medical trials and behavioral and social science experiments in the field of toxicology for example experimentation is performed on laboratory animals with the goal of defining safe exposure limits for humans balancing the constraints are views from the medical field regarding the randomization of patients  if no one knows which therapy is better there is no ethical imperative to use one therapy or another p 380 regarding experimental design it is clearly not ethical to place subjects at risk to collect data in a poorly designed study when this situation can be easily avoided p 393
