design science was introduced in 1963 by r buckminster fuller  who defined it as a systematic form of designing the concept of design science was taken up in s a gregory's 1966 book of the 1965 design methods conference  where he drew the distinction between scientific method and design method gregory was clear in his view that design was not a science and that design science referred to the scientific study of design herbert simon in his 1968 karl taylor compton lectures  used and popularized these terms in his argument for the scientific study of the artificial as opposed to the natural over the intervening period the two terms have co-mingled to the point where design science has come to have both meanings with the meaning of scientific study of design now predominatingcitation needed


the first edition of simon's the sciences of the artificial published in 1969 built on previous developments and motivated the development of systematic and formalized design methodologies relevant to many design disciplines for example architecture engineering urban planning medicine computer science and management studies simon's ideas about the science of design also motivated the development of design research and the scientific study of designing in his book simon also used the idea of a theory of design alluding to design science as a science of design for example the axiomatic theory of design described in suh  presents a domain independent theory that can explain or prescribe the design process the function-behavior-structure fbs ontology described in gero  presenting a domain independent ontology of design and designing is another example developing from the idea of a 'design science' there has been recurrent concern to differentiate design from science nigel cross differentiated between scientific design design science and a science of design the scientific study of design does not require or assume that the acts of designing are themselves scientific and an increasing number of research programs take this view cross uses the term 'designerly' to distinguish designing from other kinds of human activity
there is growing pressure on architects engineers lawyers managers and other design-oriented professionals to act and decide on the basis of a systematic body of evidence hevner and chatterjee provide a reference on design science research dsr in information systems including a selection of papers from the desrist conferences a look at key principles of dsr and the integration of action research with design research in 2010 122 professors promoted design science in information system research by signing a memorandum
hevner et al provide a set of seven guidelines which help information systems researchers conduct evaluate and present design-science research the seven guidelines address design as an artifact problem relevance design evaluation research contributions research rigor design as a search process and research communication
later extensions of the design science framework detail how design and research problems can be rationally decomposed by means of nested problem solving it is also explained how the regulative cycle problem investigation solution design design validation solution implementation and implementation evaluation fits in the framework peffers et al developed a model for producing and presenting information systems research the design science research process the peffers et al model has been used extensively and adams provides an example of the process model being applied to create a digital forensic process model
