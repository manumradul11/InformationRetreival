design tools are objects media or computer programs which can be used to design they may influence the process of production expression and perception of design ideas and therefore need to be applied skillfully


new ideas can come by way of experimenting with tools and methods some designers explore ideas using pencil and paper others use many different mark-making tools and resources from computers to sculpture as a means of inspiring creativity traditionally objects like pencil compass ruler drawing triangle have been considered design tools and have been used to characterize design and designers one reason for the success of traditional design tools such as pencil and paper is that these tools can be used without any special knowledge and their usage facilitates a continuous flow of thoughts
the appropriate development and presentation tools can substantially change how an audience perceives a project the media used for design can be divided in two categories visual and verbal conventionally in areas like architecture industrial design or graphic design visual media are considered more important than verbal media in other areas like engineering the use of verbal design media may be prevalent
visual design tools are for example gesture sketch drawing scale model perspective drawing photograph film video eugene s ferguson's 1977 paper in science entitled the mind's eye nonverbal thought in technology is credited for clearifying the role of visual reasoning in the thinking process in this article he reasoned that thinking with pictures is an essential strand in the intellectual history of technological development he concludes his article with the following statement
in his work claims ferguson that visual reasoning is a widely used tool used in creating technological artefacts there is ample evidence that visual methods particularly drawing play a central role in creating artefacts
verbal design tools are for example metaphor description discussion critique theory algorithm calculation program
computer programs have many functions which can be discussed in terms of design tools one of the most widely used design tools is computer-aided design cad software like autodesk inventor dss solidworks or pro engineer which enables designers to create 3d models 2d drawings and schematics of their designs cad together with digital mockup dmu and cae software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes
there is some debate whether computers enhance the creative process of design rapid production from the computer allows many designers to explore multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by traditional hand-rendering or paste-up on paper moving the designer through the creative process more quickly however being faced with limitless choices does not help isolate the best design solution and can lead to endless iterations with no clear design outcome a designer may use sketches to explore multiple or complex ideas quickly without the distractions and complications of software
