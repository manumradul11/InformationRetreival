design–bid–build or designbidbuild and abbreviated d–b–b or dbb accordingly also known as design–tender or designtender traditional method or hardbid is a project delivery method in which the agency or owner contracts with separate entities for the design and construction of a project
design–bid–build is the traditional method for project delivery and differs in several substantial aspects from design–build
there are three main sequential phases to the design–bid–build delivery method


in this phase the owner retains an architect or consulting engineer for infrastructure works to design and produce bid documents including construction drawings and technical specifications on which various general contractors will in turn bid to construct the project for building projects the architect will work with the owner to identify the owners needs develop a written program documenting those needs and then produce a conceptual andor schematic design this early design is then developed and the architect will usually bring in other design professionals including mechanical electrical and plumbing engineers mep engineers a fire protection engineer structural engineer sometimes a civil engineer and often a landscape architect to help complete the construction drawings and technical specifications the finished bid documents are coordinated by the architect and owner for issuance to general contractors during the bid phase
design fees are typically between 5-10% of the total project cost
bidding can be open in which any qualified bidder may participate or select in which a limited number of pre-selected contractors are invited to bid
the various general contractors bidding on the project obtain copies of the bid or tender documents and then put them out to multiple subcontractors for bids on sub-components of the project sub-components include items such as the concrete work structural steel frame electrical systems hvac and landscaping questions may arise during the bid or tender period and the architect will typically issue clarifications or corrections to the bid documents in the form of addenda from these elements the contractor compiles a complete bid or tender price for submission by the establish closing date and time ie bid date bids can be based on the quantities of materials in the completed construction eg as in the uk with bills of quantities the operations needed to build it eg as in operational bills or simply as a lump sum cost however these bid requirements are elucidated within the bid documents
once bids are received the architect typically reviews the bids seeks any clarifications required of the bidders investigates contractor qualifications ensures all documentation is in order including bonding if required and advises the owner as to the ranking of the bids if the bids fall in a range acceptable to the owner the owner and architect discuss the suitability of various bidders and their proposals the owner is not obligated to accept the lowest bid and it is customary for other factors including past performance and quality of other work to influence the selection process however the project is typically awarded to the general contractor with the lowest bid
in the event that all of the bids do not satisfy the needs of the owner whether for financial reasons or otherwise the owner may choose to reject all bids the following options become available to the owner
once the construction of the project has been awarded to the contractor the bid documents eg approved construction drawings and technical specifications may not be altered the necessary permits for example a building permit must be achieved from all jurisdictional authorities in order for the construction process to begin should design changes be necessary during construction whether initiated by the contractor owner or as discovered by the architect the architect may issue sketches or written clarifications the contractor may be required to document as built conditions to the owner
in most instances nearly every component of a project is supplied and installed by sub-contractors the general contractor may provide work with its own forces but it is common for a general contractor to limit its role primarily to managing the construction process and daily activity on a construction site see also construction management
during the construction phase the architect also acts as the owner's agent to review the progress of the work as it relates to pay requests from the contractor and to issue site instructions change orders or field orders or other documentation necessary to facilitate the construction process and certify that the project is built to the approved construction drawings
