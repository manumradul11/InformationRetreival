a door is a moving structure used to block off and allow access to an entrance to or within an enclosed space such as a building or vehicle similar exterior structures are called gates typically doors have an interior side that faces the inside of a space and an exterior side that faces the outside of that space while in some cases the interior side of a door may match its exterior side in other cases there are sharp contrasts between the two sides such as in the case of the vehicle door doors normally consist of a panel that swings on hinges or that slides or spins inside of a space
when open doors admit people animals ventilation or light the door is used to control the physical atmosphere within a space by enclosing the air drafts so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled doors are significant in preventing the spread of fire they also act as a barrier to noise many doors are equipped with locking mechanisms to allow entrance to certain people and keep out others as a form of courtesy and civility people often knock before opening a door and entering a room
doors are used to screen areas of a building for aesthetics keeping formal and utility areas separate doors also have an aesthetic role in creating an impression of what lies beyond doors are often symbolically endowed with ritual purposes and the guarding or receiving of the keys to a door or being granted access to a door can have special significance similarly doors and doorways frequently appear in metaphorical or allegorical situations literature and the arts often as a portent of change


the earliest in records are those represented in the paintings of the egyptian tombs in which they are shown as single or double doors each in a single piece of wood in egypt where the climate is intensely dry there would be no fear of their warping but in other countries it would be necessary to frame them which according to vitruvius iv 6 was done with stiles seasi and rails see frame and panel the spaces enclosed being filled with panels tympana let into grooves made in the stiles and rails the stiles were the vertical boards one of which tenoned or hinged is known as the hanging stile the other as the middle or meeting stile the horizontal cross pieces are the top rail bottom rail and middle or intermediate rails the most ancient doors were in timber those made for king solomon's temple being in olive wood i kings vi 31-35 which were carved and overlaid with gold the doors dwelt upon in homer would appear to have been cased in silver or brass besides olive wood elm cedar oak and cypress were used a 5000-year-old door has been found by archaeologists in switzerland
all ancient doors were hung by pivots at the top and bottom of the hanging stile which worked in sockets in the lintel and sill the latter being always in some hard stone such as basalt or granite those found at nippur by dr hilprecht dating from 2000 bc were in dolerite the tenons of the gates at balawat were sheathed with bronze now in the british museum these doors or gates were hung in two leaves each about 8 ft 4 in 2.54 m wide and 27 ft 8.2 m high they were encased with bronze bands or strips 10 in high covered with repouss decoration of figures etc the wood doors would seem to have been about 3 in thick but the hanging stile was over 14 inches 360 mm diameter other sheathings of various sizes in bronze have been found which proves this to have been the universal method adopted to protect the wood pivots in the hauran in syria where timber is scarce the doors were made in stone and one measuring 5 ft 4 in 1.63 m by 2 ft 7 in 0.79 m is in the british museum the band on the meeting stile shows that it was one of the leaves of a double door at kuffeir near bostra in syria burckhardt found stone doors 9 to 10 ft 3.0 m high being the entrance doors of the town in etruria many stone doors are referred to by dennis
the ancient greek and roman doors were either single doors double doors triple doors sliding doors or folding doors in the last case the leaves were hinged and folded back in eumachia is a painting of a door with three leaves in the tomb of theron at agrigentum there is a single four-panel door carved in stone in the blundell collection is a bas-relief of a temple with double doors each leaf with five panels among existing examples the bronze doors in the church of ss cosmas and damiano in rome are important examples of roman metal work of the best period they are in two leaves each with two panels and are framed in bronze those of the pantheon are similar in design with narrow horizontal panels in addition at the top bottom and middle two other bronze doors of the roman period are in the lateran basilica
the greek scholar heron of alexandria created the earliest known automatic door in the 1st century ad during the era of roman egypt the first foot-sensor-activated automatic door was made in china during the reign of emperor yang of sui r 604–618 who had one installed for his royal library the first automatic gate operators were later created in 1206 by the arabic inventor al-jazarineed quotation to verify
copper and its alloys were integral in medieval architecture the doors of the church of the nativity at bethlehem 6th century are covered with plates of bronze cut out in patterns those of hagia sophia at constantinople of the 8th and 9th century are wrought in bronze and the west doors of the cathedral of aix-la-chapelle 9th century of similar manufacture were probably brought from constantinople as also some of those in st marks venice the bronze doors on the aachen cathedral in germany date back to about ad 800 bronze baptistery doors at the cathedral of florence were completed in 1423 by ghiberti for more information see copper in architecture
of the 11th and 12th centuries there are numerous examples of bronze doors the earliest being one at hildesheim germany 1015 the hildesheim design affected the concept of gniezno door in poland of others in south italy and sicily the following are the finest in sant andrea amalfi 1060 salerno 1099 canosa 1111 troia two doors 1119 and 1124 ravello 1179 by barisano of trani who also made doors for trani cathedral and in monreale and pisa cathedrals by bonano of pisa in all these cases the hanging stile had pivots at the top and bottom the exact period when the hinge was substituted is not quite known but the change apparently brought about another method of strengthening and decorating doors viz with wrought-iron bands of infinite varieties of design as a rule three bands from which the ornamental work springs constitute the hinges which have rings outside the hanging stiles fitting on to vertical tenons run into the masonry or wooden frame there is an early example of the 12th century in lincoln in france the metal work of the doors of notre dame at paris is perhaps the most beautiful in execution but examples are endless throughout france and england
returning to italy the most celebrated doors are those of the battistero di san giovanni florence which together with the door frames are all in bronze the borders of the latter being perhaps the most remarkable the modeling of the figures birds and foliage of the south doorway by andrea pisano 1330 and of the east doorway by ghiberti 1425–1452 are of great beauty in the north door 1402–1424 ghiberti adopted the same scheme of design for the paneling and figure subjects in them as andrea pisano but in the east door the rectangular panels are all filled with bas-reliefs in which scripture subjects are illustrated with innumerable figures these being probably the gates of paradise of which michelangelo speaks
the doors of the mosques in cairo were of two kinds those which externally were cased with sheets of bronze or iron cut out in decorative patterns and incised or inlaid with bosses in relief and those in wood which were framed with interlaced designs of the square and diamond this latter description of work being coptic in its origin the doors of the palace at palermo which were made by saracenic workmen for the normans are fine examples and in good preservation a somewhat similar decorative class of door to these latter is found in verona where the edges of the stiles and rails are beveled and notched
in the renaissance period the italian doors are quite simple their architects trusting more to the doorways for effect but in france and germany the contrary is the case the doors being elaborately carved especially in the louis xiv and louis xv periods and sometimes with architectural features such as columns and entablatures with pediment and niches the doorway being in plain masonry while in italy the tendency was to give scale by increasing the number of panels in france the contrary seems to have been the rule and one of the great doors at fontainebleau which is in two leaves is entirely carried out as if consisting of one great panel only
the earliest renaissance doors in france are those of the cathedral of st sauveur at aix 1503 in the lower panels there are figures 3 ft 0.91 m high in gothic niches and in the upper panels a double range of niches with figures about 2 ft 0.61 m high with canopies over them all carved in cedar the south door of beauvais cathedral is in some respects the finest in france the upper panels are carved in high relief with figure subjects and canopies over them the doors of the church at gisors 1575 are carved with figures in niches subdivided by classic pilasters superimposed in st maclou at rouen are three magnificently carved doors those by jean goujon have figures in niches on each side and others in a group of great beauty in the center the other doors probably about forty to fifty years later are enriched with bas-reliefs landscapes figures and elaborate interlaced borders
when it comes to the world's largest door there is not just one in fact there are four and they all belong to nasa's vehicle assembly building at the kennedy space center the vehicle assembly building was originally built to assembly of apollo and saturn vehicles and was then used to support space shuttle operations each of the four doors are 139 meters or 456 feet high in comparison the statue of liberty is only 93 meters or 305 feet high
the oldest door in england can be found in westminster abbey and dates from 1050 in england in the 17th century the door panels were raised with bolection or projecting moldings sometimes richly carved round them in the 18th century the moldings worked on the stiles and rails were carved with the egg and tongue ornament
there are many kinds of doors with different purposes the most common type is the single-leaf door which consists of a single rigid panel that fills the doorway there are many variations on this basic design such as the double-leaf door or double door and french windows which have two adjacent independent panels hinged on each side of the doorway
a decorated door from the namdroling monastery southern india
a carved cedar door in the great mosque of kairouan the mosque of uqba in tunisia
door in rural punjab
a french window known as patio door in uk and portafinestra in italy where it is a common window-door type
open internal door in a shaker public building
front door of a house with typical door furniture a letter box door knocker a latch and two locks
most doors are hinged along one side to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction but not the other the axis of rotation is usually vertical in some cases such as hinged garage doors the axis may be horizontal above the door opening
doors can be hinged so that the axis of rotation is not in the plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens this requires a mechanism so that the axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens this is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes such as for the door to the toilet which opens inward
a swing door has special double-action hinges that allow it to open either outwards or inwards and is usually sprung to keep it closed
a selfbolting door has special hinges that permit the panel leaf to move laterally so that the door itself becomes a giant bolt for better security the selfbolting door principle can be used both for hinged doors as for rotating doors as well as up-and-over doors in the latter case the bolts are then placed at top and bottom rather than at the sides
french doors are derived from an original french design called the casement door it is a door with lites where all or some panels would be in a casement door a french door traditionally has a moulded panel at the bottom of the door it is called a french window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf and in which the doors may swing out typically as well as in
a mead door developed by s mead of leicester swings both ways it is susceptible to forced entry due to its design
a dutch door or stable door consists of two halves the top half operates independently from the bottom half a variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible but because the lower part has a lip on the inside closing the top part while leaving the lower part open is not
a garden door resembles a french window with lites but is more secure because only one door is operable the hinge of the operating door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch is located at the wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an espagnolette bolt
it is often useful to have doors which slide along tracks often for space or aesthetic considerations
a bypass door is a door unit that has two or more sections the doors can slide in either direction along one axis on parallel overhead tracks sliding past each other they are most commonly used in closets in order to access one side of the closet at a time the doors in a bypass unit will overlap slightly when viewed from the front in order not to have a visible gap between them
doors which slide between two wall panels are called pocket doors
sliding glass doors are common in many houses particularly as an entrance to the backyard such doors are also popular for use for the entrances to commercial structures although they are not counted as fire exit doors the door that moves is called the active leaf while the door that remains fixed is called the inactive leaf
a revolving door has several wings or leaves generally four radiating from a central shaft forming compartments that rotate about a vertical axis a revolving door allows people to pass in both directions without colliding and forms an airlock maintaining a seal between inside and out
a pivot door instead of hinges is supported on a bearing some distance away from the edge so that there is more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side in some cases the pivot is central creating two equal openings
a high-speed door is a very fast door some with opening speeds of up to 4 ms mainly used in the industrial sector where the speed of a door has an effect on production logistics temperature and pressure control high speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames they guarantee the tightness of all accesses the powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges therefore they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded high-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings generally more than 200000 a year they need to be built with heavy duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function the door curtain was originally made of pvc but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections high speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the green and energy saving requirements
in north america the door and access systems manufacturing association dasma defines high-performance doors as non-residential powered doors characterized by rolling folding sliding or swinging action that are either high-cycle minimum 100 cyclesday or high-speed minimum 20 inches508 mmsecond and two out of three of the following made-to-order for exact size and custom features designed to be able to withstand equipment impact break-away if accidentally hit by vehicle or designed to sustain heavy usage with minimal maintenance
automatically opening doors are powered open and closed either by electricity spring or both there are several methods by which an automatically opening door is activated
in addition to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors these are usually an infrared curtain or beam but can be a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door the purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motiona mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure that door will be in open state in case of power failure
up-and-over or overhead doors are often used in garages instead of hinges it has a mechanism often counterbalanced or sprung that allows it to be lifted so that it rests horizontally above the opening a roller shutter or sectional overhead door is one variant of this type
a tambour door or roller door is an up-and-over door made of narrow horizontal slats and rolls up and down by sliding along vertical tracks and is typically found in entertainment centres and cabinets
inward opening doors are doors that can only be opened or forced open from outside a building such doors pose a substantial fire risk to occupants of occupied buildings when they are locked as such doors can only be forced open from the outside building occupants would be prevented from escaping in commercial and retail situations manufacturers have included in the design a mechanism that allows an inward opening door to be pushed open outwards in the event of an emergency which is often a regulatory requirement this is known as a 'breakaway' feature pushing the door outward at its closed position through a switch mechanism disconnects power to the latch and allows the door to swing outward upon returning the door to the closed position power is restored
rebated doors a term chiefly used in britain are double doors having a lip or overlap ie a rabbet on the vertical edges where they meet fire-rating can be achieved with an applied edge-guard or astragal molding on the meeting stile in accordance with the american fire door
evolution door is a trackless door that moves in the same closure level as a sliding door the system is an invention of the austrian artist klemens torggler from the technical point of view the evolution door is a further development evolution of the drehplattentür or flip panel door that normally consists of two rotatable connected panels which move to each other when opening
architectural doors have numerous general and specialized uses doors are generally used to separate interior spaces rooms closets etc for privacy convenience security and safety reasons doors are also used to secure passages into a building from the exterior for reasons of safety and climate control
doors also are applied in more specialized cases
panel doors also called stile and rail doors are built with frame and panel construction en 12519 is describing the terms which are officially used in european member states the main parts are listed below
plank and batten doors are an older design consisting primarily of vertical slats
this type consists of vertical tongue and grooved boards held together with battens and diagonal braces
impact-resistant doors have rounded stile edges to dissipate energy and minimize edge chipping scratching and denting the formed edges are often made of an engineered material such as acrovyn impact-resistant doors excel in high traffic areas such as hospitals schools and hotels
this type consists of a solid timber frame filled on one face face with tongue and grooved boards quite often used externally with the boards on the weather face
many modern doors including most interior doors are flush doors
door swings for most of the world door swings or handing are determined while standing on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door ie standing on the side you use the key on going from outside to inside or from public to private
it is especially important to get the hand and swing right on exterior doors as the transom is usually sloped and sealed to resist water entry and to properly drain in some custom millwork or with some master carpenters the manufacture or installer will bevel the leading edge the first edge to meet the jamb as the door is closing so that the door fits tight without binding specifying an incorrect hand or swing will cause the door to bind not close properly or leak for exterior doors fixing this specification error will be expensive or time consuming see note below for australia where a different orientation is used
in north america many doors now come with factory-installed hinges pre-hung on the jamb and sills
to determine hand stand on the outside or less secure side of the door while facing the door if the hinge is on the right side of the door the door is right handed or if the hinge is on the left it is left handed
if the door swings toward you it is reverse swing or if the door swings away from you it is normal swing
in other words
note in australia this is different the refrigerator rule applies you can't stand in a fridge the door always opens towards you – if the hinges are on the left then it is a left hand or left hung door if the hinges are on the right then it is a right hand or right hung door see the australian standards for installation of timber doorsets as 1909–1984 pg 6
in europe one of the oldest din standard applies din 107 building construction identification of right and left side first 1922-05 current 1974-04 defines that doors are categorized from the side where the door hinges can be seen if the hinges are on the left it's a din left door din links din gauche if the hinges are on the right it's a din right door din rechts din droite the din right and din left marking are also used to categorize matching installation material such as mortise locks referenced in din 107 the european standard din en 12519 windows and pedestrian doors terminology includes these definitions of orientation
in public buildings exterior doors should open to the outside in order to comply with any fire codes that may be in force in that jurisdiction if the door opens inward and there is a fire there can be a crush of people who run for the door and they will not be able to open it
new exterior doors are largely defined by the type of materials they are made from wood steel fiberglass upvcvinyl aluminum composite glass patio doors
wooden doors – including solid wood doors – are a top choice for many homeowners largely because of the aesthetic qualities of wood many wood doors are custom-made but they have several downsides their price their maintenance requirements regular painting and staining and their limited insulating value  r-5 to r-6 not including the effects of the glass elements of the doors
steel doors are another major type of residential front doors most of them come with a polyurethane or other type of foam insulation core – a critical factor in a building's overall comfort and efficiency
most modern exterior walls are designed to provide thermal insulation and energy efficiency which can be indicated by the energy star label or the passive house standards and that’s where premium composite including steel doors with a thick core of polyurethane or other foam fiberglass and vinyl doors become interesting from a thermal standpoint these doors can benefit from the materials they are made from
but there are very few door models with an r-value close to 10 which is far less than the r-40 walls or the r-50 ceilings of super-insulated buildings – passive solar and zero energy buildings typical doors are not thick enough to provide very high levels of energy efficiency
many doors may have good r-values at their center but their overall energy efficiency is reduced because of the presence of glass and reinforcing elements or because of poor weatherstripping and the way the door is manufactured
door weatherstripping is particularly important for energy efficiency german-made passive house doors use multiple weatherstrips including magnetic strips to meet higher standards these weatherstrips are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage
the standard door sizes in the us run along 2 increments customary sizes have a height of 78 1981 mm or 80 2032 mm and a width of 18 472 mm 24 610 mm 26 660 mm 28 711 mm 30 762 mm or 36 914 mm most residential passage room to room doors are 30 x 80 762 mm x 2032 mm
a standard us residential exterior door size is 36 x 80 91 x 203 cm interior doors for wheelchair access must also have a minimum width of 3'-0 91 cm residential interior doors are often somewhat smaller being 6'-8 high as are many small stores offices and other light commercial buildings larger commercial public buildings and grand homes often use doors of greater height older buildings often have smaller doors
thickness most pre-fabricated doors are 1 38 thick for interior doors or 1 34 exterior
closets small spaces such as closets dressing rooms half-baths storage rooms cellars etc often are accessed through doors smaller than passage doors in one or both dimensions but similar in design
garages garage doors are generally 7'-0 or 8'-0 wide for a single-car opening two car garage doors sometimes called double car doors are a single door 16'-0 because of size and weight these doors are usually sectional that is split into four or five horizontal sections so that they can be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing there are single piece double garage doors found in some older homes circa 1950's
the standard din doors are defined in din 18101 published 1955-07 1985-01 2014-08 the door sizes are also given in the construction standard for wooden door panels din 68706-1 the din commission was also responsible for the harmonized european standard din en 14351-1 for exterior doors and din en 14351-2 for interior doors published 2006-07 2010-08 which defines the requirements for the ce marking giving standard sizes by examples in the appendix
the din 18101 standard has a normative size nennmaß slightly larger than the panel size türblatt as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors the din 181011985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985 mm normativ height 2010 mm at panel widths of 610 mm 735 mm 860 mm 985 mm 1110 mm plus a larger door panel size of 1110 mm x 2110 mm the newer din 181012014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes in favor of a basic raster running along 125 mm increments where the height and width are independent the panel width may be in the range 485 mm to 1360 mmm and the height may be in the range of 1610 mm to 2735 mm the most common interior door is 860 mm x 1985 mm 33.8 x 78.1
when framed in wood for snug fitting of a door the doorway consists of two vertical jambs on either side a lintel or head jamb at the top and perhaps a threshold at the bottom when a door has more than one movable section one of the sections may be called a leaf see door furniture for a discussion of attachments to doors such as door handles doorknobs and door knockers
door furniture or hardware refers to any of the items that are attached to a door or a drawer to enhance its functionality or appearance this includes items such as hinges handles door stops etc
door safety relates to prevention of door-related accidents such accidents take place in various forms and in a number of locations ranging from car doors to garage doors accidents vary in severity and frequency according to the national safety council in the united states 300000 injuries are caused by doors every year
the types of accidents vary from relatively minor cases where doors cause damage to other objects such as walls to serious cases resulting in human injury particularly to fingers a closing door can exert up to 40 tons per square inch of pressure between the hinges because of the number of accidents taking place there has been a surge in the number of lawsuits thus organisations may be at risk when car doors or doors within buildings are unprotected
according to the us general services administration
whenever a door is opened outwards there is a risk that it could strike another person in many cases this can be avoided by architectural design which favors doors which open inwards into rooms from the perspective of a common area such as a corridor the door opens outwards in cases where this is infeasible it may be possible to avoid an accident by placing windows in the door
however inward-hinged doors can also escalate an accident by preventing people from escaping the building people inside the building may press against the doors and thus prevent the doors from opening this was partly the case in the grue church fire in norway in 1822
today the exterior doors of most large especially public buildings open outward while interior doors such as doors to individual rooms offices suites etc open inward as do many exterior doors of houses particularly in north america
doorstops are simple devices used to prevent a door from coming into contact with another object typically a wall without the door stop damage might be done to the wall they may either absorb the force of a moving door or hold the door in place to prevent unintended motion
the purpose of door guards also known as hinge guards anti-finger trapping devices or finger guards is to reduce the number of finger trapping accidents in doors as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door there are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed
there are various levels of door protection front door protection a front anti-finger trapping device but leaves the rear hinge pin side of the door unprotected full door protection uses front and rear anti-finger trapping devices and ensures the hinge side of a door is fully protected which level of protection is appropriate should be determined by a risk assessment of the door
there is also handle-side door protection which prevents the door from slamming shut on the frame which can cause injury to fingershands
a safety door prevents finger injuries near the hinges without the use of door guards rather than cover the danger area the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place this is achieved by adding a perfectly circular bull-nose shaped extension to the door which moves in and out of a cavity as the door opens and closes this prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges – either inside or outside these doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a doorstop
glass doors pose the risk of unintentional collision if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed or is unaware there is a door at all this risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding glass doors because they often have large single panes which are hard to see to prevent injury from glass doors stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface to make it more visible for instance in the uk regulation 14 of the workplace health and safety regulations 1992 requires the marking of windows and glass doors to make them conspicuous australian standards as1288 and as2208 require glass doors to be made from laminated or toughened glass
special purpose fire doors are often employed in buildings to reduce the overall risk of fire particularly by preventing the spread of fire and smoke in cases where they are improperly installed employed or tampered with the risk of fire can be increased door closers are sometimes used to ensure fire doors remain closed
an additional risk in a fire is that doors may prevent access to emergency services personnel in order to fight the fire rescue occupants etc door breaching techniques may be required in these situations to gain access
panic bars are often used in buildings so that a door locked from the exterior can quickly and easily be opened from the inside in the event of a fire or other emergency
there may be an increased risk of trapping hands or fingers in car doors compared to other types of doors due to the proximity in which the occupant sits in some car accidents injury to occupants from the movement of car doors may occurcitation needed
bicyclists often fear collision with an opening car door in case the car's occupant does not look carefully to check that it is safe to open the door because cyclists often ride near parked cars along the side of the road see door zone they are particularly vulnerable
doors which lead from interior pressurized sections of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk if they are inadvertently opened during flight this can be mitigated by having doors that open inwardly and are designed to be forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure – most cabin doors are of this type however an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure
a number of accidents have occurred where outward-opening aircraft doors were opened in flight often accidentally
