a double envelope house is a passive solar house design which collects solar energy in a solarium and passively allows the warm air to circulate around the house between two sets of walls a double building envelope this design is from 1975 by lee porter butler in the united states


lee porter butler's 1975 double envelope shell design  received wide publicity after the us solar energy tax credits were created in 1978 versions were on the cover of better homes and gardens and popular science  magazines
butler was an artisticecological building designer a self-proclaimed ekotect  he did not hold formal qualifications as an energy engineer lee had built hundreds of homes shopping centers and business buildings including banks and schools by the time he entered north carolina state university to study architecture he had studied engineering at georgia institute of technology lee did not even have a high school diploma but ended up teaching his invention of the gravity geo-thermal envelope at the university of california berkeley in the graduate school of design and planning lee went to school for the education not for the diploma he was asked to speak at the royal college of science in london where sir isaac newton delivered principia
lee's facile and curious mind led him his entire life to question methods by which humanity could live on the earth in harmony with the earth and with each other his most recent contribution to humanity ekotecture is a totally self-sufficient way to live in harmony on the planet and to safeguard human life no matter what the external conditions lee felt that if we talk about sustainability we must talk about not just sustaining the earth but the sustaining of human life his contributions include a method whereby humanity can live peaceably and safely on the planet in cooperation
butler's experimental design was a form of isolated passive solar design that incorporated a passive heat distribution system it attempted to address the problem of unequal distribution of heat that was associated with some direct gain systems  this phenomenon is observed particularly in designs with inadequate thermal mass poor cross ventilation and excessive polar facing windows
butler's design essentially composed of a house within a house thermal energy was captured from a south-facing solarium and heat was circulated by a natural convection flow loop in the cavity between the two building envelopes and through a sub-floor or via earth cooling tubes
a recirculating air flow path resulted from the warm less-dense air rising in a south-side solarium and cooler denser air falling on the north side to create pressure differentials that automatically moved excess solar thermal gain from the south to the north side of the building without forced convection systems air flow was proportional to the differences in temperature between the two convection paths
in the summer shading devices eliminate all direct solar gain vents are opened at the top to exhaust hot air fresh air intake uses ambient temperature earth to cool and dehumidify replacement air at the base
in winter the air in the cavity is buffered by warm ambient-temperature earth under the floor which is partially recharged by the natural convection flow loop during each winter day in the summer the convective flow is replaced with cooler near-ambient-temperature earth replacement air and the warm air exhausts by natural convection
the original explanation provided for its efficiency was the thermal buffer that existed in the double envelope cavity however observers have also commented that the overall insulation of the design is higher with two walls instead of just one
while the design can perform better than a conventional home formal performance monitoring suggested there were some problems with the original design 
commentators have criticised the design on various groundscitation needed
subsequent modifications have attempted to address these issues
a modification based on butler's original design has been described but not yet formally evaluated it attempted to eliminate some of the initial issues
an important difference is the northern limb of the convection loop thermal buffer zonetbz is employed as a utility area eg laundry room closets pantry and storage space the laundry room also doubled as an area for clothes drying
an external window is located on the north side which can be opened to admit mild air into the tbz during summer an additional internal window separates the south side living quarters this can be opened to admit warm winter air from the solarium to enter directly into northern rooms
the designer states that on cold winter days the tbz tempered with solar-heated air could be often above 85 degrees f while the outside air was below freezing
current technology makes it difficult to model the effects of these convective flow designs because computer performance simulation software does not presently incorporate these processes in their calculations
