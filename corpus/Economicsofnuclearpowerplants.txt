the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject since there are diverging views on this topic and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant but low direct fuel costs with much of the costs of fuel extraction processing use and long term storage externalized therefore comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants cost estimates also need to take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage costs on the other hand measures to mitigate global warming such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading may favor the economics of nuclear power
in recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult which has an impact on large projects such as nuclear reactors with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks in eastern europe a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania and some potential backers have pulled out where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects former exelon ceo john rowe said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the us don’t make any sense right now and won’t be economic as long as gas prices remain low
analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties to date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies where many of the risks associated with construction costs operating performance fuel price and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants
two of the four eprs under construction the olkiluoto nuclear power plant in finland and flamanville in france which were meant to lead a nuclear renaissance are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost following the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats


john quiggin an economics professor says that the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically viable professor of science and technology ian lowe has also challenged the economics of nuclear power however nuclear supporters continue to champion reactors often with proposed new but largely untested designs as a source of new power
independent reviews often show that nuclear power plants are necessarily very expensive but anti-nuclear groups frequently produce reports that say the costs of nuclear energy are prohibitively high this is despite the fact that the cost of electricity in nuclear france is approximately half of that in germany and denmark in ontario canada hydroelectricity and nuclear have by far the cheapest generation costs at 4.3ckwh and 5.9ckwh respectively whilst solar costs 50.4ckwh the cost of nuclear power also needs to be compared with that of the alternatives if it proves possible to move to a post-carbon economy the community will be required to meet the costs of the replacement source many countries including russia south korea india and china have continued to pursue new builds globally 71 nuclear power plants were under construction in 15 countries as of january 2015 according to the iaea china has 25 reactors under construction but according to a government research unit china must not build too many nuclear power reactors too quickly in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel equipment and qualified plant workers according to the world nuclear association the global trend is for new nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old plants being retired
in the united states nuclear power faces competition from the low natural gas prices in north america former exelon ceo john rowe said in 2012 that new nuclear plants in the us don’t make any sense right now and won’t be economic as long as gas prices remain low
the usual rule of thumb for nuclear power is that about two thirds of the generation cost is accounted for by fixed costs the main ones being the cost of paying interest on the loans and repaying the capital 
capital cost the building and financing of nuclear power plants represents a large percentage of the cost of nuclear electricity in 2014 the us energy information administration estimated that for new nuclear plants going online in 2019 capital costs will make up 74% of the levelized cost of electricity higher than the capital percentages for fossil-fuel power plants 63% for coal 22% for natural gas and lower than the capital percentages for some other nonfossil-fuel sources 80% for wind 88% for solar pv
areva the french nuclear plant operator offers that 70% of the cost of a kwh of nuclear electricity is accounted for by the fixed costs from the construction process some analysts argue for example steve thomas professor of energy studies at the university of greenwich in the uk quoted in the book the doomsday machine by martin cohen and andrew mckillop that what is often not appreciated in debates about the economics of nuclear power is that the cost of equity that is companies using their own money to pay for new plants is generally higher than the cost of debt another advantage of borrowing may be that once large loans have been arranged at low interest rates - perhaps with government support - the money can then be lent out at higher rates of return
one of the big problems with nuclear power is the enormous upfront cost these reactors are extremely expensive to build while the returns may be very great they're also very slow it can sometimes take decades to recoup initial costs since many investors have a short attention span they don't like to wait that long for their investment to pay off
because of the large capital costs for nuclear power and the relatively long construction period before revenue is returned servicing the capital costs of a nuclear power plant is the most important factor determining the economic competitiveness of nuclear energy the investment can contribute about 70% to 80% of the costs of electricity the discount rate chosen to cost a nuclear power plant's capital over its lifetime is arguably the most sensitive parameter to overall costs
the recent liberalization of the electricity market in many countries has made the economics of nuclear power generation less attractive and no new nuclear power plants have been built in a liberalized electricity market previously a monopolistic provider could guarantee output requirements decades into the future private generating companies now have to accept shorter output contracts and the risks of future lower-cost competition so they desire a shorter return on investment period this favours generation plant types with lower capital costs even if associated fuel costs are higher a further difficulty is that due to the large sunk costs but unpredictable future income from the liberalized electricity market private capital is unlikely to be available on favourable terms which is particularly significant for nuclear as it is capital-intensive industry consensus is that a 5% discount rate is appropriate for plants operating in a regulated utility environment where revenues are guaranteed by captive markets and 10% discount rate is appropriate for a competitive deregulated or merchant plant environment however the independent mit study 2003 which used a more sophisticated finance model distinguishing equity and debt capital had a higher 11.5% average discount rate
as states are declining to finance nuclear power plants the sector is now much more reliant on the commercial banking sector according to research done by dutch banking research group profundo commissioned by banktrack in 2008 private banks invested almost €176 billion in the nuclear sector champions were bnp paribas with more than €135 billion in nuclear investments and citigroup and barclays on par with both over €114 billion in investments profundo added up investments in eighty companies in over 800 financial relationships with 124 banks in the following sectors construction electricity mining the nuclear fuel cycle and other
construction delays can add significantly to the cost of a plant because a power plant does not earn income and currencies can inflate during construction longer construction times translate directly into higher finance charges modern nuclear power plants are planned for construction in five years or less 42 months for candu acr-1000 60 months from order to operation for an ap1000 48 months from first concrete to operation for an epr and 45 months for an esbwr as opposed to over a decade for some previous plants however despite japanese success with abwrs two of the four eprs under construction in finland and france are significantly behind schedule
in the us many new regulations were put in place in the years before and again immediately after the three mile island accident's partial meltdown resulting in plant startup delays of many years the nrc has new regulations in place now see combined construction and operating license and the next plants will have nrc final design approval before the customer buys them and a combined construction and operating license will be issued before construction starts guaranteeing that if the plant is built as designed then it will be allowed to operate—thus avoiding lengthy hearings after completion
in japan and france construction costs and delays are significantly diminished because of streamlined government licensing and certification procedures in france one model of reactor was type-certified using a safety engineering process similar to the process used to certify aircraft models for safety that is rather than licensing individual reactors the regulatory agency certified a particular design and its construction process to produce safe reactors us law permits type-licensing of reactors a process which is being used on the ap1000 and the esbwr
in canada cost overruns for the darlington nuclear generating station largely due to delays and policy changes are often cited by opponents of new reactors construction started in 1981 at an estimated cost of $7.4 billion 1993-adjusted cad and finished in 1993 at a cost of $14.5 billion 70% of the price increase was due to interest charges incurred due to delays imposed to postpone units 3 and 4 46% inflation over a 4-year period and other changes in financial policy no new nuclear reactor has since been built in canada although a few have been and are undergoing refurbishment and environment assessment is complete for 4 new generation stations at darlington with the government committed in keeping a nuclear base load of 50% or around 10gw
in the uk and the us cost overruns on nuclear plants contributed to the bankruptcies of several utility companies in the us these losses helped usher in energy deregulation in the mid-1990s that saw rising electricity rates and power blackouts in california when the uk began privatizing utilities its nuclear reactors were so unprofitable they could not be sold eventually in 1996 the government gave them away but the company that took them over british energy had to be bailed out in 2004 to the extent of 3.4 billion pounds
in general coal and nuclear plants have the same types of operating costs operations and maintenance plus fuel costs however nuclear has lower fuel costs but higher operating and maintenance costs
nuclear plants require fissile fuel generally the fuel used is uranium although other materials may be used see mox fuel or thorium in 2005 prices on the world market for uranium averaged us$20lb us$44.09kg on 2007-04-19 prices reached us$113lb us$249.12kg on 2008-07-02 the price had dropped to $59lb
fuel costs account for about 28% of a nuclear plant's operating expenses as of 2013 half the cost of reactor fuel was taken up by enrichment and fabrication so that the cost of the uranium concentrate raw material was 14 percent of operating costs doubling the price of uranium would add about 10% to the cost of electricity produced in existing nuclear plants and about half that much to the cost of electricity in future power plants
as of 2008 mining activity was growing rapidly especially from smaller companies but putting a uranium deposit into production takes 10 years or more the world's present measured resources of uranium economically recoverable at a price of 130 usdkg according to the industry groups organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd nuclear energy agency nea and international atomic energy agency iaea are enough to last for at least a century at current consumption rates
in 2011 benjamin k sovacool said that even on optimistic assumptions of fuel availability global reserves of uranium will only support a 2% growth in nuclear power and will only be available for 70 years he said that uranium prices like those of oil and natural gas are highly volatile
this means that uncertain uranium prices can have a grave impact on plant operating costs such price movement is hard to anticipate when some of the countries now responsible for more than 30% of the world's uranium production kazakhstan namibia niger and uzbekistan are politically unstable
all nuclear plants produce radioactive waste to pay for the cost of storing transporting and disposing these wastes in a permanent location in the united states a surcharge of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour is added to electricity bills roughly one percent of electrical utility bills in provinces using nuclear power are diverted to fund nuclear waste disposal in canada
in 2009 the obama administration announced that the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository would no longer be considered the answer for us civilian nuclear waste currently there is no plan for disposing of the waste and plants will be required to keep the waste on the plant premises indefinitely
the disposal of low level waste reportedly costs around £2000m³ in the uk high level waste costs somewhere between £67000m³ and £201000m³ general division is 80%20% of low levelhigh level waste and one reactor produces roughly 12 m³ of high level waste annually
in canada the nwmo was created in 2002 to oversee long term disposal of nuclear waste and in 2007 adopted the adapted phased management procedure long term management is subject to change based on technology and public opinion but currently largely follows the recommendations for a centralized repository as first extensively outlined in by aecl in 1988 it was determined after extensive review that following these recommendations would safely isolate the waste from the biosphere the location has not yet been determined as is expected to cost between $9 and $13 billion cad for construction and operation for 60–90 years employing roughly a thousand people for the duration funding is available and has been collected since 1978 under the canadian nuclear fuel waste management program very long term monitoring requires less staff since high-level waste is less toxic than naturally occurring uranium ore deposits within a few centuries
the primary argument for pursuing ifr-style technology today is that it provides the best solution to the existing nuclear waste problem because fast reactors can be fueled from the waste products of existing reactors as well as from the plutonium used in weapons as is the case in the operating as of 2014 bn-800 reactor depleted uranium du waste can also be used as fuel in fast reactors
at the end of a nuclear plant's lifetime the plant must be decommissioned this entails either dismantling safe storage or entombment in the united states the nuclear regulatory commission nrc requires plants to finish the process within 60 years of closing since it may cost $500 million or more to shut down and decommission a plant the nrc requires plant owners to set aside money when the plant is still operating to pay for the future shutdown costs
decommissioning a reactor that has undergone a meltdown is inevitably more difficult and expensive three mile island was decommissioned 14 years after its incident for $837 million the cost of the fukushima disaster cleanup is not yet known but has been estimated to cost around $100 billion chernobyl is not yet decommissioned different estimates put the end date between 2013 and 2020
a 2011 report for the union of concerned scientists stated that the costs of preventing nuclear proliferation and terrorism should be recognized as negative externalities of civilian nuclear power thoroughly evaluated and integrated into economic assessments—just as global warming emissions are increasingly identified as a cost in the economics of coal-fired electricity
however the commercial exploitation of high grade uranium ore bodies by the civil nuclear power sector has reduced the uranium ore quality worldwide over time and therefore this has increased the difficulty and effort that potential terrorists or rogue states must go through in order to sufficiently concentrate uranium from orecitation needed
nuclear safety and security covers the actions taken to prevent nuclear and radiation accidents or to limit their consequences with the ageing of reactors built in the 1960 and 1970s there are increased risks of major accidents this is partly due to design faults but also as a result of radiation causing embrittlement of pressure vessels new reactor designs have been proposed but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed built and operated correctly mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at fukushima in japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake according to ubs ag the fukushima i nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like japan can master nuclear safety catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable
an interdisciplinary team from mit have estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 to 2055 at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period to date there have been five serious accidents core damage in the world since 1970 one at three mile island in 1979 one at chernobyl in 1986 and three at fukushima-daiichi in 2011 corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation ii reactors this leads to on average one serious accident happening every eight years worldwide
in terms of nuclear accidents the union of concerned scientists have stated that reactor owners  have never been economically responsible for the full costs and risks of their operations instead the public faces the prospect of severe losses in the event of any number of potential adverse scenarios while private investors reap the rewards if nuclear plants are economically successful for all practical purposes nuclear power's economic gains are privatized while its risks are socialized
however the problem of insurance costs for worst-case scenarios is not unique to nuclear power hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the banqiao dam disaster where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30000 to 200000 people died or large dam failures in general private insurers base dam insurance premiums on worst-case scenarios so insurance for major disasters in this sector is likewise provided by the state in the us a limited amount of insurance cover for nuclear stations is provided by the price anderson act
any effort to construct a new nuclear facility around the world whether an existing design or an experimental future design must deal with nimby or niaby objections because of the high profiles of the three mile island accident and chernobyl disaster relatively few municipalities welcome a new nuclear reactor processing plant transportation route or nuclear burial ground within their borders and some have issued local ordinances prohibiting the locating of such facilities there
nancy folbre an economics professor at the university of massachusetts has questioned the economic viability of nuclear power following the 2011 japanese nuclear accidents
the proven dangers of nuclear power amplify the economic risks of expanding reliance on it indeed the stronger regulation and improved safety features for nuclear reactors called for in the wake of the japanese disaster will almost certainly require costly provisions that may price it out of the market
the cascade of problems at fukushima from one reactor to another and from reactors to fuel storage pools will affect the design layout and ultimately the cost of future nuclear plants
insurance available to the operators of nuclear power plants varies by nation the worst case nuclear accident costs are so large that it would be difficult for the private insurance industry to carry the size of the risk and the premium cost of full insurance would make nuclear energy uneconomic
nuclear power has largely worked under an insurance framework that limits or structures accident liabilities in accordance with the paris convention on nuclear third-party liability the brussels supplementary convention and the vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage and in the us the price-anderson act it is often argued that this potential shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of nuclear electricity
however the problem of insurance costs for worst-case scenarios is not unique to nuclear power hydroelectric power plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as the banqiao dam disaster where 11 million people lost their homes and from 30000 to 200000 people died or large dam failures in general private insurers base dam insurance premiums on worst-case scenarios so insurance for major disasters in this sector is likewise provided by the state
in canada the canadian nuclear liability act requires nuclear power plant operators to provide $75 million of liability insurance coverage claims beyond $75 million would be assessed by a government appointed but independent tribunal and paid by the federal government
in the uk the nuclear installations act of 1965 governs liability for nuclear damage for which a uk nuclear licensee is responsible the limit for the operator is £140 million
in the united states the price-anderson act has governed the insurance of the nuclear power industry since 1957 owners of nuclear power plants pay a premium each year for $375 million in private insurance for offsite liability coverage for each reactor unit this primary or first tier insurance is supplemented by a second tier in the event a nuclear accident incurs damages in excess of $375 million each licensee would be assessed a prorated share of the excess up to $111.9 million with 104 reactors currently licensed to operate this secondary tier of funds contains about $11.6 billion this results in a maximum coverage amount of $11.975 billion if 15 percent of these funds are expended prioritization of the remaining amount would be left to a federal district court if the second tier is depleted congress is committed to determine whether additional disaster relief is required in july 2005 congress extended the price-anderson act to newer facilities
the vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage and the paris convention on third party liability in the field of nuclear energy put in place two similar international frameworks for nuclear liability the limits for the conventions vary the vienna convention was adapted in 2004 to increase the operator liability to €700 million per incident but this modification is not yet ratified
the cost per unit of electricity produced kwh will vary according to country depending on costs in the area the regulatory regime and consequent financial and other risks and the availability and cost of finance costs will also depend on geographic factors such as availability of cooling water earthquake likelihood and availability of suitable power grid connections so it is not possible to accurately estimate costs on a global basis
commodity prices rose in 2008 and so all types of plants became more expensive than previously calculated in june 2008 moody's estimated that the cost of installing new nuclear capacity in the us might possibly exceed $7000kwe in final cost in comparison the reactor units already under construction in china have been reported with substantially lower costs due to significantly lower labour rates
a 2008 study by former utility staffperson craig a severance based on historical outcomes in the us said costs for nuclear power can be expected to run $0.25-0.30 per kwh
a 2008 study concluded that if carbon capture and storage were required then nuclear power would be the cheapest source of electricity even at $4038kw in overnight capital cost
in 2009 mit updated its 2003 study concluding that inflation and rising construction costs had increased the overnight cost of nuclear power plants to about $4000kwe and thus increased the power cost to $0.084kwh the 2003 study had estimated the cost as $0.067kwh
according to benjamin k sovacool the marginal levelized cost for a 1000-mwe facility built in 2009 would be 41.2 to 80.3 centskwh presuming one actually takes into account construction operation and fuel reprocessing waste storage and decommissioning
in 2014 the us energy information administration estimated the levelized cost of electricity from new nuclear power plants going online in 2019 to be $0.096kwh before government subsidies comparable to the cost of electricity from a new coal-fired power plant without carbon capture but higher than the cost from natural gas-fired plants
generally a nuclear power plant is significantly more expensive to build than an equivalent coal-fueled or gas-fueled plant if natural gas is plentiful and cheap operating costs of conventional power plants is less most forms of electricity generation produce some form of negative externality — costs imposed on third parties that are not directly paid by the producer — such as pollution which negatively affects the health of those near and downwind of the power plant and generation costs often do not reflect these external costs
a comparison of the real cost of various energy sources is complicated by several uncertainties
a uk royal academy of engineering report in 2004 looked at electricity generation costs from new plants in the uk in particular it aimed to develop a robust approach to compare directly the costs of intermittent generation with more dependable sources of generation this meant adding the cost of standby capacity for wind as well as carbon values up to £30 €45.44 per tonne co2 for coal and gas wind power was calculated to be more than twice as expensive as nuclear power without a carbon tax the cost of production through coal nuclear and gas ranged £0.022–0.026kwh and coal gasification was £0.032kwh when carbon tax was added up to £0.025 coal came close to onshore wind including back-up power at £0.054kwh — offshore wind is £0.072kwh — nuclear power remained at £0.023kwh either way as it produces negligible amounts of co2 nuclear figures included estimated decommissioning costs
a may 2008 study by the congressional budget office concludes that a carbon tax of $45 per tonne of carbon dioxide would probably make nuclear power cost competitive against conventional fossil fuel for electricity generation
estimates of total lifetime energy returned on energy invested vary greatly depending on the study an overview can be found here table 2
the effect of subsidies is difficult to gauge as some are indirect such as research and development a may 12 2008 editorial in the wall street journal stated for electricity generation the eiaenergy information administration an office of the department of energy concludes that solar energy is subsidized to the tune of $24.34 per megawatt hour wind $23.37 and 'clean coal' $29.81 by contrast normal coal receives 44 cents natural gas a mere quarter hydroelectric about 67 cents and nuclear power $1.59
however the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry do not involve cash payments rather they shift construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns defaults to accidents and nuclear waste management this approach has remained remarkably consistent throughout the nuclear industry's history and distorts market choices that would otherwise favor less risky energy investments
in 2011 benjamin k sovacool said that when the full nuclear fuel cycle is considered - not only reactors but also uranium mines and mills enrichment facilities spent fuel repositories and decommissioning sites - nuclear power proves to be one of the costliest sources of energy
in 2014 brookings institution published the net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies which states after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis that the net benefits of new nuclear hydro and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power moreover paul joskow of mit has determined that the levelized cost of electricitylcoe metric is a poor means of comparing electricity sources as it hides the extra costs such as the need to frequently operate back up power stations incurred due to the use of intermittent power sources such as wind energy while the value of baseload power sources are underpresented
an eu-funded research study known as externe or externalities of energy undertaken from 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30% if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health from the particulate matter nitrogen oxides chromium vi river water alkalinity mercury poisoning and arsenic emissions produced by these sources were taken into account it was estimated in the study that these external downstream fossil fuel costs amount up to 1-2% of the eu's gross domestic product and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was included the study also found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power per unit of energy delivered was lower than many renewable sources including that caused by biomass and photovoltaic solar panels but was higher than the external costs associated with wind power and alpine hydropower
kristin shrader-frechette analysed 30 papers on the economics of nuclear power for possible conflicts of interest she found of the 30 18 had been funded either by the nuclear industry or pro-nuclear governments and were pro-nuclear 11 were funded by universities or non-profit non-government organisations and were anti-nuclear the remaining 1 had unknown sponsors and took the pro-nuclear stance the pro-nuclear studies were accused of using cost-trimming methods such as ignoring government subsides and using industry projections above empirical evidence where ever possible the situation was compared to medical research where 98% of industry sponsored studies return positive results
nuclear power plants tend to be very competitive in areas where other fuel resources are not readily availablecitation needed — france most notably has almost no native supplies of fossil fuels france's nuclear power experience has also been one of paradoxically increasing rather than decreasing costs over time
making a massive investment of capital in a project with long-term recovery might impact a company's credit rating
a council on foreign relations report on nuclear energy argues that a rapid expansion of nuclear power may create shortages in building materials such as reactor-quality concrete and steel skilled workers and engineers and safety controls by skilled inspectors this would drive up current prices it may be easier to rapidly expand for example the number of coal power plants without this having a large effect on current pricescitation needed
some existing lwr type plants have limited ability to significantly vary their output to match changing demand called load-following other pwrs as well as candu bwr have load-following capability which will allow them to fill more than baseline generation needs some newer reactors also offer some form of enhanced load-following capability for example the areva epr can slew its electrical output power between 990 and 1650 mw at 82.5 mw per minute the number of companies that manufacture certain parts for nuclear reactors is limited particularly the large forgings used for reactor vessels and steam systems only four companies japan steel works china first heavy industries russia's omz izhora and korea's doosan heavy industries currently manufacture pressure vessels for reactors of 1100 mge or larger some have suggested that this poses a bottleneck that could hamper expansion of nuclear power internationally however some western reactor designs require no steel pressure vessel such as candu derived reactors which rely on individual pressurized fuel channels the large forgings for steam generators — although still very heavy — can be produced by a far larger number of suppliers
nuclear plants require 20–83 percent more cooling water than other power stationsbetter source needed during times of abnormally high seasonal temperatures or drought it may be necessary for reactors drawing from small bodies of water to reduce power or shut down nuclear plants situated on large lakes seas or oceans are not affected by seasonal temperature variations due to the thermal stability of large bodies of water in some regions such as the gravelines nuclear station in france the waste-heat water is used by local aqua-farmers to increase fish production
the nuclear power industry in western nations has a history of construction delays cost overruns plant cancellations and nuclear safety issues despite significant government subsidies and support in december 2013 forbes magazine reported that in developed countries reactors are not a viable source of new power even in developed nations where they make economic sense they are not feasible because nuclear’s enormous costs political and popular opposition and regulatory uncertainty this view echoes the statement of former exelon ceo john rowe who said in 2012 that new nuclear plants don’t make any sense right now and won’t be economically viable in the foreseeable future john quiggin economics professor also says the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable quiggin says that we need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialization former nrc member peter bradford and professor ian lowe have recently made similar statements however some nuclear cheerleaders and lobbyists in the west continue to champion reactors often with proposed new but largely untested designs as a source of new power
significant new build activity is occurring in developing countries like south korea india and china china has 25 reactors under construction however according to a government research unit china must not build too many nuclear power reactors too quickly in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel equipment and qualified plant workers
nuclear power construction costs have varied significantly across the world and in time massive and rapid increases in cost occurred in the 1970s especially in the us but these trends were much milder in other countries there were no construction starts of nuclear power reactors between 1979 and 2012 in the us and recent cost trends in countries such as japan and korea have been very different including periods of stability and decline in cost
the 1.6 gwe epr reactor is being built in olkiluoto nuclear power plant finland a joint effort of french areva and german siemens ag it will be the largest pressurized water reactor pwr in the world the olkiluoto project has been claimed to have benefited from various forms of government support and subsidies including liability limitations preferential financing rates and export credit agency subsidies but the european commission's investigation didn't find anything illegal in the proceedings however as of august 2009 the project is more than three years behind schedule and at least 55% over budget reaching a total cost estimate of €5 billion $7 billion or close to €3100 $4400 per kilowatt finnish electricity consumers interest group elfi oy evaluated in 2007 the impact of olkiluoto-3 to be slightly over 6% or €3mwh to the average market price of electricity within nord pool spot the delay is therefore costing the nordic countries over 1.3 billion euros per year as the reactor would replace more expensive methods of production and lower the price of electricity
russia has begun building the world's first floating nuclear power plant the £100 million vessel the akademik lomonosov is the first of seven plants 70 mwe per ship that moscow says will bring vital energy resources to remote russian regions
following the fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats after fukushima the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity built by 2035
many license applications filed with the us nuclear regulatory commission for proposed new reactors have been suspended or cancelled as of october 2011 plans for about 30 new reactors in the united states have been reduced to 14 there are currently five new nuclear plants under construction in the united states watts bar 2 summer 2 summer 3 vogtle 3 vogtle 4 matthew wald from the new york times has reported that the nuclear renaissance is looking small and slow
in 2013 four aging uncompetitive reactors were permanently closed in the us san onofre 2 and 3 in california crystal river 3 in florida and kewaunee in wisconsin the state of vermont is trying to close vermont yankee in vernon new york state is seeking to close indian point nuclear power plant in buchanan 30 miles from new york city the additional cancellation of five large reactor uprates prairie island 1 reactor lasalle 2 reactors and limerick 2 rectors four by the largest nuclear company in the us suggest that the nuclear industry faces a broad range of operational and economic problems
as of july 2013 economist mark cooper has identified some us nuclear power plants that face particularly significant challenges to their continued operation due to regulatory challenges by local politicians these are palisades fort calhoun nine mile point fitzpatrick ginna oyster creek vermont yankee millstone clinton indian point cooper said the lesson here for policy makers and economists is clear nuclear reactors are simply not competitive
