electric energy consumption is the form of energy consumption that uses electric energy electric energy consumption is the actual energy demand made on existing electricity supply


consumption of electric energy is measured in watt-hours written w·h equal to watts x hours
electric and electronic devices consume electric energy to generate desired output ie light heat motion etc during operation some part of the energy—depending on the electrical efficiency—is consumed in unintended output such as waste heat
electricity has been generated in power stations since 1882 the invention of the steam turbine in 1883 to drive the electric generator started a strong increase of world electricity consumption
in 2008 the world total of electricity production was 20279 terawatt-hours twh this number corresponds to an average rate of around 2.3 terawatts continuously during the year the total energy needed to produce this power is roughly a factor 2 to 3 higher because a power plants' efficiency of generating electricity is roughly 30–50% the generated power is thus in the order of 5 tw this is approximately a third of the total energy consumption of 15 tw see world energy consumption
in 2005 the primary energy used to generate electricity was 41.60 quadrillion btu coal 21.01 quads natural gas 6.69 quads petroleum 1.32 quads nuclear electric power 8.13 quads renewable energy 4.23 quads respectively the gross generation of electricity in that year was 14.50 quads the difference 27.10 quads was conversion losses among all electricity 4.84 quads was used in residential area 4.32 quads used in commercial 3.47 quads used in industrial and 0.03 quads used in transportation 1 quad = 1.055 exajoule
16816 twh 83% of electric energy was consumed by final users the difference of 3464 twh 17% was consumed in the process of generating power and lost in transmission to end users
a sensitivity analysis on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy network model for electric demand estimation shows that employment is the most critical factor influencing electrical consumption the study used six parameters as input data employment gdp dwelling population hdd and cdd with electricity demand as output variable
at the world level energy consumption was cut down by 1.5% during 2009 for the first time since world war ii except in asia and middle east consumptions were reduced in all the world regions in oecd countries accounting for 53% of the total electricity demand scaled down by more than 4.5% in both europe and north america while it shrank by above 7% in japan electricity demand also dropped by more than 4.5% in cis countries driven by a large cut in russian consumption conversely in china and india 22% of the world's consumption electricity consumption continued to rise at a strong pace +6-7% to meet energy demand related to high economic growth in middle east growth rate was softened but remained high just below 4%
the table lists the top 37 electricity consuming countries which use 19000 twha ie 90% of the consumption of all more than 190 countries the total consumption including the amount consumed by the power plants and the energy sources to generate this electricity is given per country the data are of 2012 the last column contains the number of millions of inhabitants
total consumption 2nd column divided by number of inhabitants last column gives a country's consumption per head in w-europe this is between 5 and 8 mwha 1 mwh equals 1000 kwh in scandinavia usa canada taiwan and south korea it is much more in developing countries much less the worlds average is 3 mwha a very low consumption per head as in indonesia means that many inhabitants are not connected to the electricity grid and this is the reason that the world's 7th and 8th most populous countries—nigeria 177m and bangladesh 156m—do not appear in the table
listed countries are top 20 populous countries andor top 20 gdp ppp countries and saudi arabia as of cia world factbook 2009 30 countries exclude euiea in this table represent 77% of world population 84% of world gdp 83% of world electricity generation productivity per electricity generation concept similar to energy intensity can be measured by dividing gdp amount by the electricity generated world average was $3.5 productionkwh electricity generation include final consumption in process consumption and losses
about 17% of total electricity production is consumed by in-processes such as self-consumption of power plants grid losses and storage losses in 2008 total electricity generation accounted for 20261 twh while 3464 twh were self-consumption and losses and 16816 twh went to final consumption
in the consumption rate in industry china is highest with 67.8% south korea is 51.0% 7th germany 46.1% 11th japan 31.5% 26th usa 24.0% 28th in the commercial and public service japan is highest with 36.4% usa 35.6% 3rd china 5.4% 29th for domestic usage saudi arabia is highest with 56.9% usa 36.2% 8th japan 29.8% 16th china 15.5% 29th korea 13.8% 30th
definition
electric energy consumption per inhabitant by primary energy source in some countries and areas in 2008 is in the table
for the oecd with 8 991 kwhyrperson 1.026 wattperson
in all scenarios increasing efficiency will result in less electricity needed for a given demand of power and light but demand will increase strongly on account of
as transport and heating become more climate-friendly the environmental effect of energy consumption will be more determined by electricity this is mainly supplied by burning fossil fuel which disturbs the natural carbon cycle the scenarios arrive at very different results for the environment
the international energy agency expects revision of subsidy for fossil fuel which amounted to 550 billion dollar in 2013 more than four times renewable energy subsidy in this scenario almost half of the increase in 2040 of electricity consumption is covered by more than 80% growth of renewable energy many new nuclear plants will be constructed mainly to replace old ones the nuclear part of electricity generation will not increase much from 11 to 12% the renewable part goes up much from 21 to 33% that is not enough the iea warns that in order to restrict global warming to 2ºc the carbon dioxide emission must not exceed 1000 gigaton gt from 2014 this limit is reached in 2040 and emission will not drop to zero then
the world energy council sees world electricity consumption increasing to more than 40000 twha in 2040 the fossil part of generation depends on energy policy it can stay around 70% in the so-called jazz scenario where countries rather independently improvise but it can also decrease to around 40% in the symphony scenario if countries work orchestrated for more climate friendly policy carbon dioxide emission 32 gta in 2012 will increase to 46 gta in jazz but decrease to 26 gta in symphony accordingly until 2040 the renewable part of generation will stay at about 20% in jazz but increase to about 45% in symphony
