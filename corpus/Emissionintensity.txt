an emission intensity is the average emission rate of a given pollutant from a given source relative to the intensity of a specific activity for example grams of carbon dioxide released per megajoule of energy produced or the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions produced to gross domestic product gdp emission intensities are used to derive estimates of air pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions based on the amount of fuel combusted the number of animals in animal husbandry on industrial production levels distances traveled or similar activity data emission intensities may also be used to compare the environmental impact of different fuels or activities the related terms emission factor and carbon intensity are often used interchangeably but factors exclude aggregate activities such as gdp and carbon excludes other pollutants one commonly used figure is carbon intensity per kilowatt or cipk which is used to compare different sources of electrical power


emission factors assume a linear relation between the intensity of the activity and the emission resulting from this activity
emissionpollutant = activity  emission factorpollutant
intensities are also used in projecting possible future scenarios such as those used in the ipcc assessments along with projected future changes in population economic activity and energy technologies the interrelations of these variables is treated under the so-called kaya identity
the level of uncertainty of the resulting estimates depends significantly on the source category and the pollutant some examples
a literature review of numerous total life cycle energy sources co2 emissions per unit of electricity generated conducted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change in 2011 found that the co2 emission value that fell within the 50th percentile of all total life cycle emissions studies were as follows

the following tables show carbon intensity of gdp in market exchange rates mer and purchasing power parities ppp units are metric tons of carbon dioxide per thousand year 2005 us dollars data are taken from the us energy information administration annual data between 1980 and 2009 are averaged over three decades 1980-89 1990–99 and 2000–09
in 2009 co2 intensity of gdp in the oecd countries reduced by 2.9% and amounted to 0.33 kco2$05p in the oecd countries $05p = 2005 us dollars using purchasing power parities the usa posted a higher ratio of 0.41 kco2$05p while europe showed the largest drop in co2 intensity compared to the previous year −3.7% co2 intensity continued to be roughly higher in non-oecd countries despite a slight improvement china continued to post a high co2 intensity 0.81 kco2$05p co2 intensity in asia rose by 2% during 2009 since energy consumption continued to develop at a strong pace important ratios were also observed in countries in cis and the middle east
total co2 emissions from energy use were 5% below their 1990 level in 2007 over the period 1990–2007 co2 emissions from energy use have decreased on average by 0.3%year although the economic activity gdp increased by 2.3%year after dropping until 1994 −1.6%year the co2 emissions have increased steadily 0.4%year on average until 2003 and decreased slowly again since on average by 0.6%year total co2 emissions per capita decreased from 8.7 t in 1990 to 7.8 t in 2007 that is to say a decrease by 10% almost 40% of the reduction in co2 intensity is due to increased use of energy carriers with lower emission factors total co2 emissions per unit of gdp the co2 intensity decreased more rapidly than energy intensity by 2.3%year and 1.4%year respectively on average between 1990 and 2007

one of the most important uses of emission factors is for the reporting of national greenhouse gas inventories under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the so-called annex i parties to the unfccc have to annually report their national total emissions of greenhouse gases in a formalized reporting format defining the source categories and fuels that must be included
the unfccc has accepted the revised 1996 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories developed and published by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc as the emission estimation methods that must be used by the parties to the convention to ensure transparency completeness consistency comparability and accuracy of the national greenhouse gas inventories these ipcc guidelines are the primary source for default emission factors recently ipcc has published the 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories these and many more greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on ipcc's emission factor database commercially applicable organisational greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on the search engine emissionfactorscom
particularly for non-co2 emissions there is often a high degree of uncertainty associated with these emission factors when applied to individual countries in general the use of country-specific emission factors would provide more accurate estimates of emissions than the use of the default emission factors according to the ipcc if an activity is a major source of emissions for a country 'key source' it is 'good practice' to develop a country-specific emission factor for that activity
national air pollution emission inventories are required annually under the provisions of the unece convention on long-range transboundary air pollution lrtap emission estimation methods and the associated emission factors for air pollutants have been developed by the emep task force on emission inventories and projections tfeip and are published in the emepcorinair emission inventory guidebook
the us plans to cut carbon intensity per dollar of gdp by 18% by 2012 this has been criticised by the world resources institute as this approach does not ensure absolute reductions if gdp grows faster than intensity declines
from 1990 to 2000 the carbon intensity of the us economy declined by 17% yet total emissions increased by 14% in 2002 the us national environmental trust labelled carbon intensity a bookkeeping trick which allows the administration to do nothing about global warming while unsafe levels of emissions continue to rise
