the emissivity of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in emitting energy as thermal radiation thermal radiation is light but for objects near room temperature this light is infrared and is not visible to human eyes the thermal radiation from very hot objects see photograph is easily visible to the eye quantitatively emissivity is the ratio of the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an ideal black surface at the same temperature as given by the stefan–boltzmann law the ratio varies from 0 to 1 the surface of a black object emits thermal radiation at the rate of approximately 448 watts per square meter at room temperature 25 °c 298.15 k real objects with emissivities less than 1.0 emit radiation at correspondingly lower rates
emissivities are important in several contexts


hemispherical emissivity of a surface denoted ε is defined as
where
spectral hemispherical emissivity in frequency and spectral hemispherical emissivity in wavelength of a surface denoted εν and ελ respectively are defined as
where
directional emissivity of a surface denoted εω is defined as
where
spectral directional emissivity in frequency and spectral directional emissivity in wavelength of a surface denoted ενω and ελω respectively are defined as
where
emissivities ε can be measured using simple devices such as leslie's cube in conjunction with a thermal radiation detector such as a thermopile or a bolometer the apparatus compares the thermal radiation from a surface to be tested with the thermal radiation from a nearly ideal black sample the detectors are essentially black absorbers with very sensitive thermometers that record the detector's temperature rise when exposed to thermal radiation for measuring room temperature emissivities the detectors must absorb thermal radiation completely at infrared wavelengths near 10×10−6 meters visible light has a wavelength range of about 0.4 to 0.7×10−6 meters from violet to deep red
emissivity measurements for many surfaces are compiled in many handbooks and texts some of these are listed in the following table
notes
there is a fundamental relationship gustav kirchhoff's 1859 law of thermal radiation that equates the emissivity of a surface with its absorption of incident radiation the absorptivity of a surface kirchhoff's law explains why emissivities cannot exceed 1 since the largest absorptivity - corresponding to complete absorption of all incident light by a truly black object - is also 1 mirror-like metallic surfaces that reflect light will thus have low emissivities since the reflected light isn't absorbed a polished silver surface has an emissivity of about 0.02 near room temperature black soot absorbs thermal radiation very well it has an emissivity as large as 0.97 and hence soot is a fair approximation to an ideal black body
with the exception of bare polished metals the appearance of a surface to the eye is not a good guide to emissivities near room temperature thus white paint absorbs very little visible light however at an infrared wavelength of 10x10−6 meters paint absorbs light very well and has a high emissivity similarly pure water absorbs very little visible light but water is nonetheless a strong infrared absorber and has a correspondingly high emissivity
in addition to the total hemispherical emissivities compiled in the table above a more complex directional spectral emissivity can also be measured this emissivity depends upon the wavelength and upon the angle of the outgoing thermal radiation kirchhoff's law actually applies exactly to this more complex emissivity the emissivity for thermal radiation emerging in a particular direction and at a particular wavelength matches the absorptivity for incident light at the same wavelength and angle the total hemispherical emissivity is a weighted average of this directional spectral emissivity the average is described by textbooks on radiative heat transfer
emittance or emissive power is the total amount of thermal energy emitter per unit area per unit time for all possible wavelengths emissivity of a body at a given temperature is the ratio of the total emissive power of a body to the total emissive power of a perfectly black body at that temperature
the term emissivity is generally used to describe a simple homogeneous surface such as silver similar terms emittance and thermal emittance are used to describe thermal radiation measurements on complex surfaces such as insulation products
