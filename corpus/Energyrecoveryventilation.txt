energy recovery ventilation erv is the energy recovery process of exchanging the energy contained in normally exhausted building or space air and using it to treat precondition the incoming outdoor ventilation air in residential and commercial hvac systems during the warmer seasons the system pre-cools and dehumidifies while humidifying and pre-heating in the cooler seasons the benefit of using energy recovery is the ability to meet the ashrae ventilation & energy standards while improving indoor air quality and reducing total hvac equipment capacity
this technology has not only demonstrated an effective means of reducing energy cost and heating and cooling loads but has allowed for the scaling down of equipment additionally this system will allow for the indoor environment to maintain a relative humidity of 40% to 50% this range can be maintained under essentially all conditions the only energy penalty is the power needed for the blower to overcome the pressure drop in the system


nearly half of global energy is used in buildings and half of heatingcooling cost is caused by ventilation when it is done by the open window method according to the regulations secondly energy generation and grid is made to meet the peak demand of power to use proper ventilation recovery is a cost-efficient sustainable and quick way to reduce global energy consumption and give better indoor air quality iaq and protect buildings sick building syndrome sbs and environment
an energy recovery ventilator also abbreviated erv is a type of air-to-air heat exchanger that not only transfers sensible heat but also latent heat because both temperature and moisture are transferred ervs can be considered total enthalpic devices on the other hand a heat recovery ventilator hrv can only transfer sensible heat hrvs can be considered sensible only devices because they only exchange sensible heat in other words whereas all ervs are hrvs not all hrvs are ervs but many people use the terms hrv aahx air-to-air heat exchanger and erv interchangeably
throughout the cooling season the system works to cool and dehumidify the incoming outside air this is accomplished by the system taking the rejected heat and sending it into the exhaust airstream subsequently this air cools the condenser coil at a lower temperature than if the rejected heat had not entered the exhaust airstream during the heating seasons the system works in reverse instead of discharging the heat into the exhaust airstream the system draws heat from the exhaust airstream in order to pre-heat the incoming air at this stage the air passes through a primary unit and then into a space with this type of system it is normal during the cooling seasons for the exhaust air to be cooler than the ventilation air and during the heating seasons warmer than the ventilation air it is for this reason the system works very efficiently and effectively the coefficient of performance cop will increase as the conditions become more extreme ie more hot and humid for cooling and colder for heating
the efficiency of an erv system is the ratio of energy transferred between the two air streams compared with the total energy transported through the heat exchanger
be warned that efficiency claims above 50% can not mean you recover half the outgoing conditioned content given the nature of the systems in question since heat transfer is driven by a temperature gradient the best the two air streams could ever do is to meet in the middle of outgoing and incoming temperatures assuming equal flow rates which is the point of the hrv considering this the maximum amount of conditioned content that can be recovered is 12 that assumes perfect heat exchange and totally ignores the cost of operating the hrv fan the diagrams you see with a red airstream that turns blue and a blue that turns red would be less disingenuous if the blue turned pinkish blue and the red turned pink with the variety of products on the market efficiency is unquestionably going to vary from product to product some of these systems have been known to have heat exchange efficiencies as high as 70-80% while others have as low as 50% even though this lower figure is preferable to the basic hvac system it is not up to par with the rest of its class studies are being done to increase the heat transfer efficiency to 90%
the use of modern low-cost gas-phase heat exchanger technology will allow for significant improvements in efficiency the use of high conductivity porous material is believed to produce an exchange effectiveness in excess of 90% by exceeding a 90% effective rate an improvement of up to 5 factors in energy loss can be seen
the home ventilation institute hvi has developed a standard test for any and all units manufactured within the united states regardless not all have been tested it is imperative to investigate efficiency claims comparing data produced by hvi as well as that produced by the manufacturer note all units sold in canada are placed through the r-2000 program a standard test synonymous to the hvi test
*total energy exchange only available on hygroscopic units and condensate return units
the rotating wheel heat exchanger is composed of a rotating cylinder filled with an air permeable material resulting in a large surface area the surface area is the medium for the sensible energy transfer as the wheel rotates between the ventilation and exhaust air streams it picks up heat energy and releases it into the colder air stream the driving force behind the exchange is the difference in temperatures between the opposing air streams which is also called the thermal gradient typical media used consists of polymer aluminum and synthetic fiber
the enthalpy exchange is accomplished through the use of desiccants desiccants transfer moisture through the process of adsorption which is predominately driven by the difference in the partial pressure of vapor within the opposing air-streams typical desiccants consist of silica gel and molecular sieves
enthalpy wheels are the most effective devices to transfer both latent and sensible energy but there are many different types of construction that dictate the wheel's durability the most common materials used in the construction of the rotor are polymer aluminum and fiberglass
when using rotary energy recovery devices the two air streams must be adjacent to one another to allow for the local transfer of energy also there should be special considerations paid in colder climates to avoid wheel frosting systems can avoid frosting by modulating wheel speed preheating the air or stopjogging the system
fixed plate heat exchangers have no moving parts and consist of alternating layers of plates that are separated and sealed typical flow is cross current and since the majority of plates are solid and non permeable sensible only transfer is the result
the tempering of incoming fresh air is done by a heat or energy recovery core in this case the core is made of aluminum or plastic plates humidity levels are adjusted through the transferring of water vapor this is done with a rotating wheel either containing a desiccant material or permeable plates
enthalpy plates were introduced 2006 by paul a special company for ventilation systems for passive houses a crosscurrent countercurrent air-to-air heat exchanger built with a humidity permeable material polymer fixed-plate countercurrent energy recovery ventilators were introduced in 1998 by building performance equipment bpe a residential commercial and industrial air-to-air energy recovery manufacturer these heat exchangers can be both introduced as a retrofit for increased energy savings and fresh air as well as an alternative to new construction in new construction situations energy recovery will effectively reduce the required heatingcooling capacity of the system the percentage of the total energy saved will depend on the efficiency of the device up to 90% sensible and the latitude of the building
due to the need to use multiple sections fixed plate energy exchangers are often associated with high pressure drop and larger footprints due to their inability to offer a high amount of latent energy transfer these systems also have a high chance for frosting in colder climates
the technology patented by finnish company recyclingenergy int corp is based on a regenerative plate heat exchanger taking advantage of humidity of air by cyclical condensation and evaporation eg latent heat enabling not only high annual thermal efficiency but also microbe-free plates due to self-cleaningwashing method therefore the unit is called an enthalpy recovery ventilator rather than heat or energy recovery ventilator companyÂ´s patented latentheatpump is based on its enthalpy recovery ventilator having cop of 33 in the summer and 15 in the winter
