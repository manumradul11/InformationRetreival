engineering physics refers to the study of the combined disciplines of physics mathematics and engineering in order to develop an enhanced understanding of the interrelationship between them by focussing on the scientific method as a rigorous basis it seeks ways to apply and develop new solutions in engineering engineering physics or engineering science degrees are respected academic degrees awarded in many countries it can be taught at the undergraduate level and is often designed as an honors program at some universities due to the rigorous nature of the academic curriculum which covers a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines


unlike traditional engineering disciplines engineering sciencephysics is not necessarily confined to a particular branch of science or physics instead engineering sciencephysics is meant to provide a more thorough grounding in applied physics for a selected specialty such as optics quantum physics materials science applied mechanics nanotechnology microfabrication mechanical engineering electrical engineering biophysics control theory aerodynamics energy solid-state physics etc it is the discipline devoted to creating and optimizing engineering solutions through enhanced understanding and integrated application of mathematical scientific statistical and engineering principles the discipline is also meant for cross-functionality and bridges the gap between theoretical science and practical engineering with emphasis in research and development design and analysis
it is notable that in many languages the term for engineering physics would be directly translated into english as technical physics in some countries both what would be translated as engineering physics and what would be translated as technical physics are disciplines leading to academic degrees with the former specializes in nuclear power research and the latter closer to engineering physics in some institutions engineering or applied physics major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science or applied science
in many universities engineering science programs may be offered at the levels of btech bsc msc and phd usually a core of basic and advanced courses in mathematics physics chemistry and biology forms the foundation of the curriculum while typical elective areas may include fluid dynamics quantum physics economics plasma physics relativity solid mechanics operations research quantitative finance information technology and engineering dynamical systems bioengineering environmental engineering computational engineering engineering mathematics and statistics solid-state devices materials science electromagnetism nanoscience nanotechnology energy and optics while typical undergraduate engineering programs generally focus on the application of established methods to the design and analysis of engineering solutions undergraduate program in engineering science focuses on the creation and use of more advanced experimental or computational techniques where standard approaches are inadequate ie development of engineering solutions to contemporary problems in the physical and life sciences by applying fundamental principles
some examples of universities that offer engineering physics or engineering science programs include university of oxfordbauman moscow state technical university queen's university brown university mit indian institute of technology bombayrensselaer polytechnic university of illinois at urbana-champaign stanford university cornell university tulane university embry-riddle aeronautical universitymurray state university wheeling jesuit university university of the pacific polytechnique montreal virginia tech university of british columbia university of toronto telkom university eafit university surya university simon fraser university mcmaster university pennsylvania state university university of colorado itesm campus monterrey and royal institute of technology
