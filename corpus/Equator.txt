an equator is the intersection of the surface of a rotating sphere with the plane that is perpendicular to the sphere's axis of rotation and midway between its poles the equator usually refers to the earth's equator an imaginary line on the earth's surface equidistant from the north pole and south pole dividing the earth into the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere the equator is about 40075 kilometres 24901 mi long some 78.7% lies across water and 21.3% over land other planets and astronomical bodies have equators similarly defined


the latitude of the earth's equator is by definition 0° zero degrees of arc the equator is one of the five notable circles of latitude on earth the other four are the two polar circles the arctic circle and the antarctic circle and the two tropical circles the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn the equator is the only line of latitude which is also a great circle — that is one whose plane passes through the center of the globe the plane of earth's equator when projected outwards to the celestial sphere defines the celestial equator
in the cycle of earth's seasons the plane of the equator passes through the sun twice per year at the march and september equinoxes to an observer on the earth the sun appears to travel north or south over the equator or the celestial equator at these times light rays from the center of the sun are perpendicular to the surface of the earth at the point of solar noon on the equator
locations on the equator experience the quickest sunrises and sunsets because the sun moves nearly perpendicular to the horizon for most of the year the length of daylight sunrise to sunset is almost constant throughout the year it is about 14 minutes longer than nighttime due to atmospheric refraction and the fact that sunrise is begun or sunset is ended as the upper edge not the centre of the sun's disk crosses the horizon
the earth bulges slightly at the equator the average diameter of the earth is 12750 kilometres 7922 mi but the diameter at the equator is about 43 kilometres 27 mi greater than at the poles
sites near the equator such as the guiana space centre in kourou french guiana are good locations for spaceports as they have a faster rotational speed than other latitudes the added velocity reduces the fuel needed to launch spacecraft because the earth spins to the east spacecraft must also launch to the east or to the southeast or northeast to take advantage of this earth-boost of speed
the precise location of the equator is not truly fixed the true equatorial plane is perpendicular to the earth's spin axis which drifts about 9 metres 30 ft during a year this effect must be accounted for in detailed geophysical measurements
seasons result from the yearly revolution of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution during the year the northern and southern hemispheres are inclined toward or away from the sun according to earth's position in its orbit the hemisphere inclined toward the sun receives more sunlight and is in summer while the other hemisphere receives less sun and is in winter see solstice at the equinoxes the earth's axis is not tilted toward the sun instead it is perpendicular to the sun meaning that the day is about 12 hours long as is the night across the whole of the earth
near the equator there is little distinction between summer winter autumn or spring the temperatures are usually high year-round—with the exception of high mountains in south america and in africa see andes and mount kilimanjaro the temperature at the equator can plummet during rainstorms in many tropical regions people identify two seasons the wet season and the dry season but many places close to the equator are on the oceans or rainy throughout the year the seasons can vary depending on elevation and proximity to an ocean
the equator lies mostly on the three largest oceans the pacific ocean the atlantic ocean and the indian ocean the highest point on the equator is at the elevation of 4690 metres 15387 ft at 0°0′0″n 77°59′31″w﻿  ﻿0.00000°n 77.99194°w﻿  0.00000 -77.99194﻿ highest point on the equator found on the southern slopes of volcán cayambe summit 5790 metres 18996 ft in ecuador this is slightly above the snow line and is the only place on the equator where snow lies on the ground at the equator the snow line is around 1000 metres 3280 ft lower than on mount everest and as much as 2000 metres 6560 ft lower than the highest snow line in the world near the tropic of capricorn on llullaillaco
the equator traverses the land of 11 countries it also passes through two island nations though without making a landfall in either starting at the prime meridian and heading eastwards the equator passes through
despite its name no part of equatorial guinea's territory lies on the equator however its island of annobón is 155 kilometres 96 mi south of the equator and the rest of the country lies to the north
certain navies such as the royal navy and the us navy have a tradition of holding ceremonies on board ship to mark sailors' first crossing of the equator these rites of initiation have in the past been notorious for their brutality milder line-crossing ceremonies typically featuring king neptune are also held for passengers' entertainment on some civilian ocean liners and cruise shipscitation needed
in two widely used geodetic standards the equator is modelled as a circle whose radius is a whole number of metres in 1976 the iau chose a radius of 6378.140 kilometres 3963.192 mi later refined by the iugg to 6378.137 kilometres 3963.191 mi and adopted in wgs-84 though the yet more recent iau-2000 has retained the old iau-1976 value if it were really circular the length of the equator would be exactly 2π times the radius namely 40075.036 kilometres 24901.473 mi however due to the effect of tidal force on the earth's surface the actual circumference at the equator is 40075.16 kilometres 24901.55 mi
the geographical mile is defined as one arc minute of the equator so it has different values depending on which radius is assumed eg 1855.3248 metres 6087.024 ft for wgs84 or 1855.3257 metres 6087.027 ft for iau-2000
the earth is modelled commonly as a sphere flattened 0.336% along its axis this makes the equator 0.16% longer than a meridian a great circle passing through the two poles the iugg standard meridian is to the nearest millimetre 40007.862917 kilometres 24859.733480 mi one arc minute of which is 1852.216 metres 6076.82 ft explaining the si standardization of the nautical mile as 1852 metres 6076 ft more than 3 metres 9.8 ft less than the geographical mile
the sea-level surface of the earth the geoid is irregular so the actual length of the equator is not so easy to determine aviation week and space technology on 9 october 1961 reported that measurements using the transit iv-a satellite had shown the equatorial diameter from longitude 11° west to 169° east to be 1000 feet 300 m greater than its diameter ninety degrees awaycitation needed
lowlands around the equator generally have a tropical rainforest climate also known as an equatorial climate though cold currents cause some regions to have tropical monsoon climates with a dry season in the middle of the year usually average annual temperature is around 30 °c 86 °f during the day and 23 °c 73 °f at night rainfall is very high usually from 2500 to 3500 mm 98 to 138 in per year average rainy days are around 200 per year and average annual sunshine hours around 2000
