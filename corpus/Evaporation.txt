evaporation is a type of vaporization of a liquid that occurs from the surface of a liquid into a gaseous phase that is not saturated with the evaporating substance the other type of vaporization is boiling which is characterized by bubbles of saturated vapor forming in the liquid phase steam produced in a boiler is another example of evaporation occurring in a saturated vapor phase evaporation that occurs directly from the solid phase below the melting point as commonly observed with ice at or below freezing or moth crystals napthalene or paradichlorobenzene is called sublimation
on average a fraction of the molecules in a glass of water have enough heat energy to escape from the liquid water molecules from the air enter the water in the glass but as long as the relative humidity of the air in contact is less than 100% saturation the net transfer of water molecules will be to the air the water in the glass will be cooled by the evaporation until an equilibrium is reached where the air supplies the amount of heat removed by the evaporating water in an enclosed environment the water would evaporate until the air is saturated
with sufficient temperature the liquid would turn into vapor quickly see boiling point when the molecules collide they transfer energy to each other in varying degrees based on how they collide sometimes the transfer is so one-sided for a molecule near the surface that it ends up with enough energy to 'escape'
evaporation is an essential part of the water cycle the sun solar energy drives evaporation of water from oceans lakes moisture in the soil and other sources of water in hydrology evaporation and transpiration which involves evaporation within plant stomata are collectively termed evapotranspiration evaporation of water occurs when the surface of the liquid is exposed allowing molecules to escape and form water vapor this vapor can then rise up and form clouds the tracking of evaporation from its source on the surface of the earth through the atmosphere as vapor or clouds and to its fate as precipitation closes the atmospheric water cycle and embodies the concept of the precipitationshed


for molecules of a liquid to evaporate they must be located near the surface they have to be moving in the proper direction and have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome liquid-phase intermolecular forces when only a small proportion of the molecules meet these criteria the rate of evaporation is low since the kinetic energy of a molecule is proportional to its temperature evaporation proceeds more quickly at higher temperatures as the faster-moving molecules escape the remaining molecules have lower average kinetic energy and the temperature of the liquid decreases this phenomenon is also called evaporative cooling this is why evaporating sweat cools the human body evaporation also tends to proceed more quickly with higher flow rates between the gaseous and liquid phase and in liquids with higher vapor pressure for example laundry on a clothes line will dry by evaporation more rapidly on a windy day than on a still day three key parts to evaporation are heat atmospheric pressure determines the percent humidity and air movement
on a molecular level there is no strict boundary between the liquid state and the vapor state instead there is a knudsen layer where the phase is undetermined because this layer is only a few molecules thick at a macroscopic scale a clear phase transition interface cannot be seen
liquids that do not evaporate visibly at a given temperature in a given gas eg cooking oil at room temperature have molecules that do not tend to transfer energy to each other in a pattern sufficient to frequently give a molecule the heat energy necessary to turn into vapor however these liquids are evaporating it is just that the process is much slower and thus significantly less visible
if evaporation takes place in an enclosed area the escaping molecules accumulate as a vapor above the liquid many of the molecules return to the liquid with returning molecules becoming more frequent as the density and pressure of the vapor increases when the process of escape and return reaches an equilibrium the vapor is said to be saturated and no further change in either vapor pressure and density or liquid temperature will occur for a system consisting of vapor and liquid of a pure substance this equilibrium state is directly related to the vapor pressure of the substance as given by the clausius–clapeyron relation
where p1 p2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures t1 t2 respectively δhvap is the enthalpy of vaporization and r is the universal gas constant the rate of evaporation in an open system is related to the vapor pressure found in a closed system if a liquid is heated when the vapor pressure reaches the ambient pressure the liquid will boil
the ability for a molecule of a liquid to evaporate is based largely on the amount of kinetic energy an individual particle may possess even at lower temperatures individual molecules of a liquid can evaporate if they have more than the minimum amount of kinetic energy required for vaporization
note air used here is a common example however the vapor phase can be other gases
in the us the national weather service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized pan open water surface outdoors at various locations nationwide others do likewise around the world the us data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map the measurements range from under 30 to over 120 inches 3000 mm per year
evaporation is an endothermic process in that heat is absorbed during evaporation
fuel droplets vaporize as they receive heat by mixing with the hot gases in the combustion chamber heat energy can also be received by radiation from any hot refractory wall of the combustion chamber
internal combustion engines rely upon the vaporization of the fuel in the cylinders to form a fuelair mixture in order to burn well the chemically correct airfuel mixture for total burning of gasoline has been determined to be 15 parts air to one part gasoline or 151 by weight changing this to a volume ratio yields 8000 parts air to one part gasoline or 80001 by volume
thin films may be deposited by evaporating a substance and condensing it onto a substrate or by dissolving the substance in a solvent spreading the resulting solution thinly over a substrate and evaporating the solvent
