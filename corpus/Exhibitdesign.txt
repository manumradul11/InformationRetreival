exhibit design or exhibition design is the process of developing an exhibit—from a concept through to a physical three-dimensional exhibition it is a continually evolving field drawing on innovative creative and practical solutions to the challenge of developing communicative environments that ‘tell a story’ in a three-dimensional space
exhibit designers or exhibition designers use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences–enabling these targeted audiences to access the messages stories and objects of an exhibit there are many different types of exhibit ranging from museum exhibitions to retail and trades show spaces to themed attractions zoos and visitor centers all types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions
exhibit design is a collaborative process integrating the disciplines of architecture landscape architecture graphic design audiovisual engineering digital media lighting interior design and content development to develop an audience experience that interprets information involves and engages a user and influences their understanding of a subject throughout the planning and design process exhibit designers work closely with graphic designers content specialists architects fabricators technical specialists audiovisual experts and in the case of museums and other mission-based institutions stakeholders like community members government agencies and other partner organizations
the exhibit design process builds on a conceptual or interpretive plan for an exhibit determining the most effective engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story the process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule moving from conceptual plan through schematic design design development contract document fabrication and installation the first phases establish a thematic direction and develop creative and appropriate design solutions to achieve the interpretive and communication goals of the exhibit the latter phases employ technical expertise in translating the visual language of the designs into detailed documents that provide all the specifications required to fabricate and install an exhibit
exhibition design in different parts of the world are influenced by the local culture as well as the availability of materials exhibition design in europe is considered as a meeting place for relationship building while in north america energy is spent on creating a sense of place and building community
one of the major shifts in museum and exhibit design in the last decade has been a focus on visitor experience by identifying the five types of museum visitors and their needs and expectations museums can design their exhibits to give a positive visitor experience participatory activities are also becoming more popular nina simon has done research describing and identifying themes and trends in museums that will attract visitors and educate them in fun and engaging ways 
the trend towards improving visitor experience is about to take a leap forward as we are entering a new era in museum design as the technologies for immersive interactive experiences become more sophisticated and widespread museum exhibit designers now have the ability to track users moving through and exhibit space to record their interactions anonymouslyand therefore either deliver tailored content to them as they move from exhibit to exhibit and or to use this data to better understand how visitors behave and what it is that interests them in the museum touch screen interfaces on digital screens such as led screens are the primary interface at the moment but it is expected that the options to interface will become much more varied in the very near future
