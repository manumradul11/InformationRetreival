in its commercial context experience design is driven by consideration of the moments of engagement or touchpoints between people and brands and the ideas emotions and memories that these moments create commercial experience design is also known as customer experience design in the domain of marketing it may be associated with experiential marketing experience designers are often employed to identify existing touchpoints and create new ones and then to score the arrangement of these touchpoints so that they produce the desired outcome
in the broader environmental context there is far less formal attention given to the design of the experienced environment physical and virtual — but though it's unnoticed experience design is taking place ronald jones describes the practice as working across disciplines often furthest from their own creating a relevant integration between concepts methods and theories experience designers design experiences over time with real and measurable consequences time is their medium according to jones the mission of experience design is to persuade stimulate inform envision entertain and forecast events influencing meaning and modifying human behavior

there is a debate occurring in the experience design community regarding its focus provoked in part by design scholar and practitioner don norman norman claims that when designers describe people only as customers consumers and users designers risk diminishing their ability to do good design given that experience is so totally an affective subjective and personal process — not an abstraction — it would be ironic it's been argued for experience designers when designing experiences to approach people merely as objects of commerce or cogs in a machine experience design perhaps more than other forms of design is transactive and transformative every experience designer is an experiencer and every experiencer via his or her reactions a designer of experience in turn while commercial contexts often describe people as customers consumers or users this and non-commercial contexts might use the words audience people and participants in either case for conscientious experience designers this is merely a semantic difference

experience design is not driven by a single design discipline instead it requires a cross-discipline perspective that considers multiple aspects of the brandbusinessenvironmentexperience from product packaging and retail environment to the clothing and attitude of employees experience design seeks to develop the experience of a product service or event along any or all of the following dimensions
while it is unnecessary or even inappropriate for all experiences to be developed highly across all of these dimensions the more in-depth and consistently a product or service is developed across them — the more responsive an offering is to a group's or individual's needs and desires eg a customer it is likely to be enhancing the affordance of a product or service its interface with people is key to commercial experience design
