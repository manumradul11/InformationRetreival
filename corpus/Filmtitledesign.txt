film title design is a term describing the craft and design of motion picture title sequences since the beginning of the film form it has been an essential part of any motion picture originally a motionless piece of artwork called title art it slowly evolved into an artform of its own
in the beginning main title design consisted of the movie studio's name andor logo and the presentation of the main characters along with the actor’s names generally using that same artwork presented on title cards most independent or major studio had their own title art logo used as the background for their screen credits and they used it almost exclusively on every movie that they produced
then early in the 1930s the more progressive motion picture studios started to change their approach in presenting their screen credits the major studios took on the challenge of improving the way they introduced their movies they made the decision to present a more complete list of credits to go with a higher quality of artwork to be used in their screen credits
a main title designer is the designer of the movie title the manner in which title of a movie is displayed on screen is widely considered an art form it's often been classified as motion graphics title design title sequences and animated credits the title sequence is often presented through animated visuals and kinetic type while the credits are introduced on screen
from the mid-1930s through the late-1940s the major film studios led the way in film title art by employing artists like al hirschfeld george petty ted ireland vencentini william galraith crawford symeon shimin alvan hap hadley and jacques kapralik
quality artists met this challenge by designing their artwork to set a mood and capture the audience before the movie started an overall 10% jump in box-office receipts was proof that this was a profitable improvement to the introduction of their motion pictures
one famous example of the form is the work of saul bass in the 1950s and 60s his modish title sequences for the films of alfred hitchcock were key in setting the style and mood of the movie even before the action began and contributed to hitchcock's house style that was a key element in his approach to marketing another well known designer is maurice binder who designed the often erotic titles for many of the james bond films from the 1960s to the 1980s after his death daniel kleinman has done several of the titles
modern technology has enabled a much more fantastical way of presenting them through use of programs such as adobe after effects and maxon cinema4d although a form of editing it's considered a different role and art form rather than of a traditional film editor
