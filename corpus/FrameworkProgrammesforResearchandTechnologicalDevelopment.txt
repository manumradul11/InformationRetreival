the framework programmes for research and technological development also called framework programmes or abbreviated fp1 through fp7 with fp8 being named horizon 2020 are funding programmes created by the european unioneuropean commission to support and foster research in the european research area era the specific objectives and actions vary between funding periods in fp6 and fp7 focus was still in technological research in horizon 2020 the focus is in innovation delivering economic growth faster and delivering solutions to end users that are often governmental agencies


conducting european research policies and implementing european research programmes is an obligation under the amsterdam treaty which includes a chapter on research and technological development the programmes are defined by commission civil servants that are aided by various official advisory group and lobby groups eg to advise the european commission on the overall strategy to be followed in carrying out the information and communication technology thematic priority the information society technologies advisory group istag was set up
the framework programmes up until framework programme 6 fp6 covered five-year periods but from framework programme 7 fp7 on programmes run for seven years the framework programmes and their budgets in billions of euros are presented in the table below for fp1–fp5 program expenditures were made in european currency units from fp6 onward budgets were in euros the values presented below are in euros
framework programme 6 and 7 2002–13 projects were generally funded through instruments the most important of which are listed below
horizon 2020 is the eighth phase of the framework programmes for research and technological development also called framework programmes hence the project's alternative name of 'fp8' funding programmes created by the european union in order to support and encourage research in the european research area era it implements europe 2020 and innovation union strategies the programme runs from 2014–20 and provides an estimated €80 billion of funding an increase of 23 per cent on the previous phase
the project became embroiled with the 2014 referendums held by switzerland which opted to impose a quota on immigration between that country and the eu switzerland which maintains bilateral agreements with the eu was intended to be a participant of horizon 2020 but negotiations that would have ensured this were put on hold in the aftermath of the decision turkey joined this funding program this funding programme also includes israel which joined after protracted negotiations about whether funding could be directed to projects beyond the green line eventually the two parties agreed to disagree and israel published its views in an appendix to the official documents open access is an underlying principle of horizon 2020 intended to improve research results create greater efficiency improve transparency and accelerate innovation
horizon 2020 is also implementing the european environmental research and innovation policy which is aimed at defining and turning into reality a transformative agenda for greening the economy and the society as a whole so as to achieve a truly sustainable development
the programme consists of three main research areas that are called pillars
the structure follows the previous framework programme fp7 2007–13 to the level of the sub-programmes under the pillars in the industrial pillar the goal is to find ways to modernize european industries that have suffered from a fragmented european market in societal challenges the goal is implementation of solutions less on technology development
the programmes have been criticized on various grounds such as actually diminishing europe's industrial competitiveness and failing to deliver fundamental excellence and global economic competitiveness in 2010 the austrian research promotion agency launched a petition calling for a simplification of administrative procedures which attracted over 13000 signatories the numerous other criticisms of the petitioners were later distilled into a green paper in horizon 2020 there are significant simplifications eg fewer funding rates increasing the funding rates of the large companies less reporting less auditing shorter time from proposal to project kick-off
