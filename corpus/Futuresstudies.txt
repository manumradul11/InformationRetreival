futures studies also called futurology is the study of postulating possible probable and preferable futures and the worldviews and myths that underlie them there is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or science in general it can be considered as a branch of the social sciences and parallel to the field of history history studies the past futures studies considers the future futures studies colloquially called futures by many of the field's practitioners seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present and to determine the likelihood of future events and trends unlike the physical sciences where a narrower more specified system is studied futures studies concerns a much bigger and more complex world system the methodology and knowledge are much less proven as compared to natural science or even social science like sociology economics and political science


futures studies is an interdisciplinary field studying yesterday's and today's changes and aggregating and analyzing both lay and professional strategies and opinions with respect to tomorrow it includes analyzing the sources patterns and causes of change and stability in an attempt to develop foresight and to map possible futures around the world the field is variously referred to as futures studies strategic foresight futuristics futures thinking futuring and futurology futures studies and strategic foresight are the academic field's most commonly used terms in the english-speaking world
foresight was the original term and was first used in this sense by hg wells in 1932 futurology is a term common in encyclopedias though it is used almost exclusively by nonpractitioners today at least in the english-speaking world futurology is defined as the study of the future the term was coined by german professor ossip k flechtheim in the mid-1940s who proposed it as a new branch of knowledge that would include a new science of probability this term may have fallen from favor in recent decades because modern practitioners stress the importance of alternative and plural futures rather than one monolithic future and the limitations of prediction and probability versus the creation of possible and preferable futurescitation needed
three factors usually distinguish futures studies from the research conducted by other disciplines although all of these disciplines overlap to differing degrees first futures studies often examines not only possible but also probable preferable and wild card futures second futures studies typically attempts to gain a holistic or systemic view based on insights from a range of different disciplines third futures studies challenges and unpacks the assumptions behind dominant and contending views of the future the future thus is not empty but fraught with hidden assumptions for example many people expect the collapse of the earth's ecosystem in the near future while others believe the current ecosystem will survive indefinitely a foresight approach would seek to analyze and highlight the assumptions underpinning such views
futures studies does not generally focus on short term predictions such as interest rates over the next business cycle or of managers or investors with short-term time horizons most strategic planning which develops operational plans for preferred futures with time horizons of one to three years is also not considered futures plans and strategies with longer time horizons that specifically attempt to anticipate possible future events are definitely part of the field
the futures field also excludes those who make future predictions through professed supernatural means at the same time it does seek to understand the models such groups use and the interpretations they give to these models
johan galtung and sohail inayatullah argue in macrohistory and macrohistorians that the search for grand patterns of social change goes all the way back to ssu-ma chien 145-90bc and his theory of the cycles of virtue although the work of ibn khaldun 1332–1406 such as the muqaddimah would be an example that is perhaps more intelligible to modern sociology some intellectual foundations of futures studies appeared in the mid-19th century according to wendell bell comte's discussion of the metapatterns of social change presages futures studies as a scholarly dialogue
the first works that attempt to make systematic predictions for the future were written in the 18th century memoirs of the twentieth century written by samuel madden in 1733 takes the form of a series of diplomatic letters written in 1997 and 1998 from british representatives in the foreign cities of constantinople rome paris and moscow however the technology of the 20th century is identical to that of madden's own era - the focus is instead on the political and religious state of the world in the future madden went on to write the reign of george vi 1900 to 1925 where in the context of the boom in canal construction at the time he envisioned a large network of waterways that would radically transform patterns of living - villages grew into towns and towns became cities
the genre of science fiction became established towards the end of the 19th century with notable writers including jules verne and h g wells setting their stories in an imagined future world
according to w warren wagar the founder of future studies was h g wells his anticipations of the reaction of mechanical and scientific progress upon human life and thought an experiment in prophecy was first serially published in the fortnightly review in 1901 anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000 the book is interesting both for its hits trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of population from cities to suburbs moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom the defeat of german militarism the existence of a european union and a world order maintained by english-speaking peoples based on the urban core between chicago and new york and its misses he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950 and averred that my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea
moving from narrow technological predictions wells envisioned the eventual collapse of the capitalist world system after a series of destructive total wars from this havoc would ultimately emerge a world of peace and plenty controlled by competent technocrats
the work was a bestseller and wells was invited to deliver a lecture at the royal institution in 1902 entitled the discovery of the future the lecture was well-received and was soon republished in book form he advocated for the establishment of a new academic study of the future that would be grounded in scientific methodology rather than just speculation he argued that a scientifically ordered vision of the future will be just as certain just as strictly science and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last hundred years to make the geological past although conscious of the difficulty in arriving at entirely accurate predictions he thought that it would still be possible to arrive at a working knowledge of things in the future
in his fictional works wells predicted the invention and use of the atomic bomb in the world set free 1914 in the shape of things to come 1933 the impending world war and cities destroyed by aerial bombardment was depicted however he didn't stop advocating for the establishment of a futures science in a 1933 bbc broadcast he called for the establishment of departments and professors of foresight foreshadowing the development of modern academic futures studies by approximately 40 years
futures studies emerged as an academic discipline in the mid-1960s first-generation futurists included herman kahn an american cold war strategist who wrote on thermonuclear war 1960 thinking about the unthinkable 1962 and the year 2000 a framework for speculation on the next thirty-three years 1967 bertrand de jouvenel a french economist who founded futuribles international in 1960 and dennis gabor a hungarian-british scientist who wrote inventing the future 1963 and the mature society a view of the future 1972
future studies had a parallel origin with the birth of systems science in academia and with the idea of national economic and political planning most notably in france and the soviet union in the 1950s france was continuing to reconstruct their war-torn country in the process french scholars philosophers writers and artists searched for what could constitute a more positive future for humanity the soviet union similarly participated in postwar rebuilding but did so in the context of an established national economic planning process which also required a long-term systemic statement of social goals future studies was therefore primarily engaged in national planning and the construction of national symbols
by contrast in the united states futures studies as a discipline emerged from the successful application of the tools and perspectives of systems analysis especially with regard to quartermastering the war-effort these differing origins account for an initial schism between futures studies in america and futures studies in europe us practitioners focused on applied projects quantitative tools and systems analysis whereas europeans preferred to investigate the long-range future of humanity and the earth what might constitute that future what symbols and semantics might express it and who might articulate these
by the 1960s academics philosophers writers and artists across the globe had begun to explore enough future scenarios so as to fashion a common dialogue inventors such as buckminster fuller also began highlighting the effect technology might have on global trends as time progressed this discussion on the intersection of population growth resource availability and use economic growth quality of life and environmental sustainability – referred to as the global problematique – came to wide public attention with the publication of limits to growth a study sponsored by the club of rome
international dialogue became institutionalized in the form of the world futures studies federation wfsf founded in 1967 with the noted sociologist johan galtung serving as its first president in the united states the publisher edward cornish concerned with these issues started the world future society an organization focused more on interested laypeople
1975 saw the founding of the first graduate program in futures studies in the united states the ms program in futures studies at the university of houston–clear lake which moved to the university of houston in 2007 and renamed the degree to foresight there followed a year later the ma program in public policy in alternative futures at the university of hawaii at manoa the hawaii program provides particular interest in the light of the schism in perspective between european and us futurists it bridges that schism by locating futures studies within a pedagogical space defined by neo-marxism critical political economic theory and literary criticism in the years following the foundation of these two programs single courses in futures studies at all levels of education have proliferated but complete programs occur only rarely in 2012 the finland futures research centre started a master's degree programme in futures studies at turku school of economics a business school which is part of the university of turku in turku finland
as a transdisciplinary field futures studies attracts generalists this transdisciplinary nature can also cause problems owing to it sometimes falling between the cracks of disciplinary boundaries it also has caused some difficulty in achieving recognition within the traditional curricula of the sciences and the humanities in contrast to futures studies at the undergraduate level some graduate programs in strategic leadership or management offer masters or doctorate programs in strategic foresight for mid-career professionals some even online nevertheless comparatively few new phds graduate in futures studies each year
the field currently faces the great challenge of creating a coherent conceptual framework codified into a well-documented curriculum or curricula featuring widely accepted and consistent concepts and theoretical paradigms linked to quantitative and qualitative methods exemplars of those research methods and guidelines for their ethical and appropriate application within society as an indication that previously disparate intellectual dialogues have in fact started converging into a recognizable discipline at least six solidly-researched and well-accepted first attempts to synthesize a coherent framework for the field have appeared eleonora masini's why futures studies james dator's advancing futures studies ziauddin sardar's rescuing all of our futures sohail inayatullah's questioning the future richard a slaughter's the knowledge base of futures studies a collection of essays by senior practitioners and wendell bell's two-volume work the foundations of futures studies
some aspects of the future such as celestial mechanics are highly predictable and may even be described by relatively simple mathematical models at present however science has yielded only a special minority of such easy to predict physical processes theories such as chaos theory nonlinear science and standard evolutionary theory have allowed us to understand many complex systems as contingent sensitively dependent on complex environmental conditions and stochastic random within constraints making the vast majority of future events unpredictable in any specific case
not surprisingly the tension between predictability and unpredictability is a source of controversy and conflict among futures studies scholars and practitioners some argue that the future is essentially unpredictable and that the best way to predict the future is to create it others believe as flechtheim that advances in science probability modeling and statistics will allow us to continue to improve our understanding of probable futures while this area presently remains less well developed than methods for exploring possible and preferable futures
as an example consider the process of electing the president of the united states at one level we observe that any us citizen over 35 may run for president so this process may appear too unconstrained for useful prediction yet further investigation demonstrates that only certain public individuals current and former presidents and vice presidents senators state governors popular military commanders mayors of very large cities etc receive the appropriate social credentials that are historical prerequisites for election thus with a minimum of effort at formulating the problem for statistical prediction a much reduced pool of candidates can be described improving our probabilistic foresight applying further statistical intelligence to this problem we can observe that in certain election prediction markets such as the iowa electronic markets reliable forecasts have been generated over long spans of time and conditions with results superior to individual experts or polls such markets which may be operated publicly or as an internal market are just one of several promising frontiers in predictive futures research
such improvements in the predictability of individual events do not though from a complexity theory viewpoint address the unpredictability inherent in dealing with entire systems which emerge from the interaction between multiple individual events
futures practitioners use a wide range of models and methods theory and practice many of which come from other academic disciplines including economics sociology geography history engineering mathematics psychology technology tourism physics biology astronomy and aspects of theology specifically the range of future beliefs
one of the fundamental assumptions in futures studies is that the future is plural not singular that is that it consists of alternative futures of varying likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur the primary effort in futures studies therefore is to identify and describe alternative futures this effort includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility probability and desirability of change the plurality of the term futures in futures studies denotes the rich variety of alternative futures including the subset of preferable futures normative futures that can be studied
practitioners of the discipline previously concentrated on extrapolating present technological economic or social trends or on attempting to predict future trends but more recently they have started to examine social systems and uncertainties and to build scenarios question the worldviews behind such scenarios via the causal layered analysis method and others create preferred visions of the future and use backcasting to derive alternative implementation strategies apart from extrapolation and scenarios many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research see below
futures studies also includes normative or preferred futures but a major contribution involves connecting both extrapolated exploratory and normative research to help individuals and organisations to build better social futures amid a presumed landscape of shifting social changes practitioners use varying proportions of inspiration and research futures studies only rarely uses the scientific method in the sense of controlled repeatable and falsifiable experiments with highly standardized methodologies given that environmental conditions for repeating a predictive scheme are usually quite hard to control however many futurists are informed by scientific techniques some historians project patterns observed in past civilizations upon present-day society to anticipate what will happen in the future oswald spengler's decline of the west arguedfull citation needed for instance that western society like imperial rome had reached a stage of cultural maturity that would inexorably lead to decline in measurable ways
futures studies is often summarized as being concerned with three ps and a w or possible probable and preferable futures plus wildcards which are low probability but high impact events positive or negative should they occur many futurists however do not use the wild card approach rather they use a methodology called emerging issues analysis it searches for the seeds of change issues that are likely to move from unknown to the known from low impact to high impact
estimates of probability are involved with two of the four central concerns of foresight professionals discerning and classifying both probable and wildcard events while considering the range of possible futures recognizing the plurality of existing alternative futures characterizing and attempting to resolve normative disagreements on the future and envisioning and creating preferred futures are other major areas of scholarship most estimates of probability in futures studies are normative and qualitative though significant progress on statistical and quantitative methods technology and information growth curves cliometrics predictive psychology prediction markets crowdvoting forecastsbetter source needed etc has been made in recent decades
while forecasting – ie attempts to predict future states from current trends – is a common methodology professional scenarios often rely on backcasting asking what changes in the present would be required to arrive at envisioned alternative future states for example the policy reform and eco-communalism scenarios developed by the global scenario group rely on the backcasting method practitioners of futures studies classify themselves as futurists or foresight practitioners
futurists use a diverse range of forecasting methods including
futurists use scenarios – alternative possible futures – as an important tool to some extent people can determine what they consider probable or desirable using qualitative and quantitative methods by looking at a variety of possibilities one comes closer to shaping the future rather than merely predicting it shaping alternative futures starts by establishing a number of scenarios setting up scenarios takes place as a process with many stages one of those stages involves the study of trends a trend persists long-term and long-range it affects many societal groups grows slowly and appears to have a profound basis in contrast a fad operates in the short term shows the vagaries of fashion affects particular societal groups and spreads quickly but superficially
sample predicted futures range from predicted ecological catastrophes through a utopian future where the poorest human being lives in what present-day observers would regard as wealth and comfort through the transformation of humanity into a posthuman life-form to the destruction of all life on earth in say a nanotechnological disaster
futurists have a decidedly mixed reputation and a patchy track record at successful prediction for reasons of convenience they often extrapolate present technical and societal trends and assume they will develop at the same rate into the future but technical progress and social upheavals in reality take place in fits and starts and in different areas at different rates
many 1950s futurists predicted commonplace space tourism by the year 2000 but ignored the possibilities of ubiquitous cheap computers on the other hand many forecasts have portrayed the future with some degree of accuracy current futurists often present multiple scenarios that help their audience envision what may occur instead of merely predicting the future they claim that understanding potential scenarios helps individuals and organizations prepare with flexibility
many corporations use futurists as part of their risk management strategy for horizon scanning and emerging issues analysis and to identify wild cards – low probability potentially high-impact risks every successful and unsuccessful business engages in futuring to some degree – for example in research and development innovation and market research anticipating competitor behavior and so on
in futures research weak signals may be understood as advanced noisy and socially situated indicators of change in trends and systems that constitute raw informational material for enabling anticipatory action there is some confusion about the definition of weak signal by various researchers and consultants sometimes it is referred as future oriented information sometimes more like emerging issues the confusion has been partly clarified with the concept 'the future sign' by separating signal issue and interpretation of the future sign
wild cards refer to low-probability and high-impact events such as existential risks this concept may be embedded in standard foresight projects and introduced into anticipatory decision-making activity in order to increase the ability of social groups adapt to surprises arising in turbulent business environments such sudden and unique incidents might constitute turning points in the evolution of a certain trend or system wild cards may or may not be announced by weak signals which are incomplete and fragmented data from which relevant foresight information might be inferred sometimes mistakenly wild cards and weak signals are considered as synonyms which they are not
a long-running tradition in various cultures and especially in the media involves various spokespersons making predictions for the upcoming year at the beginning of the year these predictions sometimes base themselves on current trends in culture music movies fashion politics sometimes they make hopeful guesses as to what major events might take place over the course of the next year
some of these predictions come true as the year unfolds though many fail when predicted events fail to take place the authors of the predictions often state that misinterpretation of the signs and portents may explain the failure of the prediction
marketers have increasingly started to embrace futures studies in an effort to benefit from an increasingly competitive marketplace with fast production cycles using such techniques as trendspotting as popularized by faith popcorndubious – discuss
trends come in different sizes a mega-trend extends over many generations and in cases of climate mega-trends can cover periods prior to human existence they describe complex interactions between many factors the increase in population from the palaeolithic period to the present provides an example
possible new trends grow from innovations projects beliefs or actions that have the potential to grow and eventually go mainstream in the future
very often trends relate to one another the same way as a tree-trunk relates to branches and twigs for example a well-documented movement toward equality between men and women might represent a branch trend the trend toward reducing differences in the salaries of men and women in the western world could form a twig on that branch
when a potential trend gets enough confirmation in the various media surveys or questionnaires to show that it has an increasingly accepted value behavior or technology it becomes accepted as a bona fide trend trends can also gain confirmation by the existence of other trends perceived as springing from the same branch some commentators claim that when 15% to 25% of a given population integrates an innovation project belief or action into their daily life then a trend becomes mainstream
because new advances in technology have the potential to reshape our society one of the jobs of a futurist is to follow these developments and consider their implications however the latest innovations take time to make an impact every new technology goes through its own life cycle of maturity adoption and social application that must be taken into consideration before a probable vision of the future can be created
gartner created their hype cycle to illustrate the phases a technology moves through as it grows from research and development to mainstream adoption the unrealistic expectations and subsequent disillusionment that virtual reality experienced in the 1990's and early 2000's is an example of the middle phases encountered before a technology can begin to be integrated into society
education in the field of futures studies has taken place for some time beginning in the united states of america in the 1960s it has since developed in many different countries futures education can encourage the use of concepts tools and processes that allow students to think long-term consequentially and imaginatively it generally helps students to
thorough documentation of the history of futures education exists for example in the work of richard a slaughter 2004 david hicks ivana milojević and jennifer gidley to name a few
while futures studies remains a relatively new academic tradition numerous tertiary institutions around the world teach it these vary from small programs or universities with just one or two classes to programs that incorporate futures studies into other degrees for example in planning business environmental studies economics development studies science and technology studies various formal masters-level programs exist on six continents finally doctoral dissertations around the world have incorporated futures studies a recent survey documented approximately 50 cases of futures studies at the tertiary level
the largest futures studies program in the world is at tamkang university taiwancitation needed futures studies is a required course at the undergraduate level with between three to five thousand students taking classes on an annual basis housed in the graduate institute of futures studies is an ma program only ten students are accepted annually in the program associated with the program is the journal of futures studies
the longest running future studies program in north america was established in 1975 at the university of houston–clear lake it moved to the university of houston in 2007 and renamed the degree to foresight the program was established on the belief that if history is studied and taught in an academic setting then so should the future its mission is to prepare professional futurists the curriculum incorporates a blend of the essential theory a framework and methods for doing the work and a focus on application for clients in business government nonprofits and society in general
as of 2003 over 40 tertiary education establishments around the world were delivering one or more courses in futures studies the world futures studies federation has a comprehensive survey of global futures programs and courses the acceleration studies foundation maintains an annotated list of primary and secondary graduate futures studies programs
organizations such as teach the future also aim to promote future studies in the secondary school curriculum in order to develop structured approaches to thinking about the future in public school students the rationale is that a sophisticated approach to thinking about anticipating and planning for the future is a core skill requirement that every student should have similar to literacy and math skills
several authors have become recognized as futurists they research trends particularly in technology and write their observations conclusions and predictions in earlier eras many futurists were at academic institutions john mchale author of the future of the future published a 'futures directory' and directed a think tank called the centre for integrative studies at a university futurists have started consulting groups or earn money as speakers with examples including alvin toffler john naisbitt and patrick dixon frank feather is a business speaker that presents himself as a pragmatic futurist some futurists have commonalities with science fiction and some science-fiction writers such as arthur c clarke are known as futuristscitation needed in the introduction to the left hand of darkness ursula k le guin distinguished futurists from novelists writing of the study as the business of prophets clairvoyants and futurists in her words a novelist's business is lying
a survey of 108 futurists found that they share a variety of assumptions including in their description of the present as a critical moment in an historical transformation in their recognition and belief in complexity and in their being motivated by change and having a desire for an active role bringing change versus simply being involved in forecasting
several corporations and government agencies utilize foresight products to both better understand potential risks and prepare for potential opportunities several government agencies publish material for internal stakeholders as well as make that material available to broader public examples of this include the us congressional budget office long term budget projections the national intelligence center and the united kingdom government office for science much of this material is used by policy makers to inform policy decisions and government agencies to develop long term plan several corporations particularly those with long product development lifecycles utilize foresight and future studies products and practitioners in the development of their business strategies the shell corporation is one such entity foresight professionals and their tools are increasingly being utilized in both the private and public areas to help leaders deal with an increasingly complex and interconnected world
fashion is one area of trend forecasting the industry typically works 18 months ahead of the current selling seasoncitation needed large retailers look at the obvious impact of everything from the weather forecast to runway fashion for consumer tastes consumer behavior and statistics are also important for a long-range forecast
artists and conceptual designers by contrast may feel that consumer trends are a barrier to creativity many of these ‘startists’ start micro trends but do not follow trends themselvescitation needed
design is another area of trend forecasting foresight and futures thinking are rapidly being adopted by the design industry to insure more sustainable robust and humanistic products design much like future studies is an interdisciplinary field that considers global trends challenges and opportunities to foster innovation designers are thus adopting futures methodologies including scenarios trend forecasting and futures research
holistic thinking that incorporates strategic innovative and anticipatory solutions gives designers the tools necessary to navigate complex problems and develop novel future enhancing and visionary solutions
the association for professional futurists has also held meetings discussing the ways in which design thinking and futures thinking intersect
the future of energy is a complex topic there are likely not enough new sources of oil in the earth to make up for escalating demands from china india africa and other rapidly developing economies and to replace declining fields if future energy consumption patterns of these economies mimic the historical patterns of the developed world yet as global population saturates and we move further into the information age energy intensity use of energy per gdp has been saturating slowing in rate of growth or declining in many countries there are also over a trillion and a half barrels of proven oil reserves in the world in the hands of owners who want to make sure as much of that oil is sold as possible before we move to alternative sources they have a strong incentive to keep the price of oil low enough eg below $100 a barrel to discourage too-rapid emergence of viable alternatives while many alternative sources of energy exist their rate of development and their levels of governmental and corporate r&d funding remain slow and low some futurists see a gap looming between the effective end of the age of oil and the expected emergence of new energy sources others see no such gap ahead and expect we'll leave the age of oil to one led by solar fusion natural gas and other sources with lots of oil still remaining in the ground social values changes climate change accelerating computerization and machine productivity and other factors may increasingly drive us to more sustainable energy sources with significantly fewer environmental and public health costs than oil and coal
imperial cycles represent an expanding pulsation of mathematically describable macro-historic trend the list of largest empires contains imperial record progression in terms of territory or percentage of world population under single imperial rule
chinese philosopher k'ang yu-wei and french demographer georges vacher de lapouge in the late 19th century were the first to stress that the trend cannot proceed indefinitely on the definite surface of the globe the trend is bound to culminate in a world empire k'ang yu-wei estimated that the matter will be decided in the contest between washington and berlin vacher de lapouge foresaw this contest between the united states and russia and estimated the chance of the united states higher both published their futures studies before h g wells introduced the science of future in his anticipations 1901
four later anthropologists—hornell hart raoul naroll louis morano and robert carneiro—researched the expanding imperial cycles they reached the same conclusion that a world empire is not only pre-determined but close at hand and attempted to estimate the time of its appearance
historian max ostrovsky specializing on macro-historic trends and their projection into future analyzed the inner mechanism at work in the process and applied the results to the conditions of the global system the work confirmed the inexorable trend towards a world empire he found that the development of the world order in history and its projection into future follows a hyperbolic trajectory the research was published in 2007 titled y = arctg x the hyperbola of the world order
as foresight has expanded to include a broader range of social concerns all levels and types of education have been addressed including formal and informal education many countries are beginning to implement foresight in their education policy a few programs are listed below
wendell bell and ed cornish acknowledge science fiction as a catalyst to future studies conjuring up visions of tomorrow science fiction’s potential to provide an imaginative social vision is its contribution to futures studies and public perspective productive sci-fi presents plausible normative scenarios jim dator attributes the foundational concepts of images of the future to wendell bell for clarifying fred polak’s concept in images of the future as it applies to futures studies similar to futures studies’ scenarios thinking empirically supported visions of the future are a window into what the future could be pamela sargent states science fiction reflects attitudes typical of this century she gives a brief history of impactful sci-fi publications like the foundation trilogy by isaac asimov and starship troopers by robert a heinlein alternate perspectives validate sci-fi as part of the fuzzy images of the future however the challenge is the lack of consistent futures research based literature frameworks ian miles reviews the new encyclopedia of science fiction identifying ways science fiction and futures studies cross-fertilize as well as the ways in which they differ distinctly science fiction cannot be simply considered fictionalized futures studies it may have aims other than prediction and be no more concerned with shaping the future than any other genre of literature  it is not to be understood as an explicit pillar of futures studies due to its inconsistency of integrated futures research additionally dennis livingston a literature and futures journal critic says the depiction of truly alternative societies has not been one of science fiction’s strong points especially preferred normative envisages
