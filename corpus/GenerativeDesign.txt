generative design is a design method in which the output – image sound architectural models animation – is generated by a set of rules or an algorithm normally by using a computer program most generative design is based on parametric modeling it is a fast method of exploring design possibilities that is used in various design fields such as art architecture communication design and product design typically generative design has
some generative schemes use genetic algorithms to create variations some use just random numbers generative design has been inspired by natural design processes whereby designs are developed as genetic variations through mutation and crossovers in contrast to long-established concepts such as generative art or computer art generative design also includes particular tasks within the area of design architecture and product designclarification needed
within the communication design area the main applications are the creation of information graphics diagrams and flexible corporate designs generative design in architecture also often referred to as computational design is mainly applied for form-finding processes and for the simulation of architectural structures
generative design is becoming more important largely due to new programming environments processing vvvv quartz composer open frameworks or scripting capabilities  grasshopper 3d in rhinoceros 3d scriptographer that have made it relatively easy even for designers with little programming experience to implement their ideasbut it can also be related with data driven architectture parametric architecture includes both program generated and data driven software
generative design is taught at many schools of architecture and is gaining ground in architectural and design practice
definition by celestino soddu 1992 generative design is a morphogenetic process using algorithms structured as not-linear systems for endless unique and un-repeatable results performed by an idea-code as in nature
definition by sivam krish 2013  generative design is the transformation of computational energy into creative exploration energy empowering human designers to explore greater number of design possibilities within modifiable constrains
one of the most important and distinguishing part that makes a computational model generative is the feedback loop the feedback ranges from simple mechanisms where the model takes its own output for input to relatively complex ones incorporating design evaluation routines generative methods have their roots deep in the systems dynamics modelling and are by nature repetitive processes where the solution is developed during several iterations of design operations
