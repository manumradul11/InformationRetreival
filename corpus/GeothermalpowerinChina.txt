geothermal energy exploitation in china started c 1970 in the socialist planned economy geothermal exploration was handled by national bodies with public investments drilled productive wells were transferred free of charge to the final user since the mid-1980s under the framework of privatization and liberalization of the economy national investment in exploration has been reduced no new plants have been commissioned in the period 2000–2005 zheng et al 2005 battocletti et al 2000 the only electricity-producing fields are located in tibet according to the 2005 chinese geothermal environment bulletin by china's ministry of land and resources the direct utilization of geothermal energy in china will reach 13.76 cubic meters per second and the geothermal energy will reach 10779 megawatts ranking first in the world  however such programme has not been started so far
the most important field is yangbajain geothermal field with eight double flash units for a total capacity of 24 mw fueled from a water dominated shallow reservoir at 140 °c – 160 °c with 18 wells of average depth 200 m the field extension is only 4 km2 although there are clear indications of a total thermal anomaly of 15 km2 the annual energy production is approximately 100 gw·h about 30% of the needs of the tibetan capital lhasa a deep reservoir has been discovered beneath the shallow yangbajing field it is characterized by high temperatures 250–330 °c has been measured at 1500–1800 m depth the field potential is estimated at about 50–90 mw it is still un-exploited a 2500 m deep well has been drilled in 2004 reaching the deep reservoir at 1000–1300 m its evaluation is ongoing
additional plants are installed in langju west tibet two double flash unit 1 mw each 80–180 °c and a 1 mw binary power station 60–170 °c is operating in nagqu two small 300 kw plants are operating in guangdong and hunan

this country is again one of the major users of the direct-use of geothermal energy zheng et al 2005 discusses the latest developments it appears that along with the restructuring of the economy national investment in geothermal has decreased however as the living standard of the population has risen geothermal has found favor in that the waters are used more for health tourism and balneology in various hot springs
investors are looking to increase their investment which has led to an upsurge in geothermal drilling and utilization particularly in the coastal regions of beijing and tianjin
the chinese government is culling together plans for comprehensive geothermal development in conjunction with its 13th five-year plan which covers the years 2016-2020 as part of this plan it hopes to develop 100 mw of geothermal by 2015 in northern central and southwest china it will initially focus on high-temperature resources them move to low- and medium-temperature applications
the management of the resource also plays a big role particularly in the large cities here efficiency in utilization has improved dramatically and environmental concerns are being addressed for example in beijing the total rate of extraction of hot water has been kept stable and has even decreased slightly but energy utilization in terms of gwh produced has increased significantly the data of zheng et al 2005 show that for the whole of china the installed capacity has risen to 3687 mwt with an annual energy use of 45373 tjyr including 15 heat pump units ranging from 220 to 760-kw in capacity operating at an equivalent 2880 full-load hours annually from the 2000 lund and freeston 2001 figures of 2282 mwt and 37908 tjyr an increase in annual energy use of about 20%
geothermal space heating covers 12.7 million m2 and greenhouse heating cover about 1.33 million m2 there are about 1600 public hot spring bathing houses and swimming pools including about 430 where balneology and medical practices prevail in the country the details of the specific uses are as follows district heating 550 mwt and 6391 tjyr greenhouse heating 103 mwt and 1176 tjyr fish farming 174 mwt and 1921 tjyr agricultural drying 80 mwt and 1007 tjyr industrial process heat 139 mwt and 2603 tjyr bathing and swimming 1991 mwt and 25095 tjyr other uses monitoring 19 mwt and 611 tjyr and heat pumps 631 mwt and 6569 tjyr
