a green design concept is to facilitate sustainable use of the resources – energy water and other materials – all through the complete life cycle of the building including its construction
glass is a wonder material that combines more than a few advantages such as transparency natural day-lighting blending of exteriors with interiors and acoustic control glass a wholly recyclable material supplies unrestricted occasions for architects as well as designers for the innovative applications in buildings glass plays a noteworthy role in accomplishing greater indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency and in so doing fulfills numerous criteria for green buildings
the intent of a green building design is to curtail the demand on non-renewable resources amplify utilization efficiency of these resources when in use and augment the reuse recycling and consumption of renewable resources


the design and placement of glass is a fundamental constituent of green architecture it permits natural light and puts together the interior of office and residential buildings with the exterior natural light enhances productivity in the workplace and helps uphold a healthy environment it is just as important that glass materials and design endorse energy efficiency
architects use high-performance double-glazed glass which is laminated or coated to moderate interior temperatures by controlling heat loss and gain the coating filters the heat-producing aspects of solar rays the use of such glass in green buildings is used comprehensively in tropical climates as well as the middle east
in hot climates solar control glass can be used to minimize solar heat gain and help control glare the design and placement of glass known as fenestration in specific areas of the building crafts the best environment for energy efficiency in temperate regions it can be used to equalize solar control with high levels of natural light in more serene climates architects employ operable windows as a cost-saving substitute to air-conditioning
the augmented use of glass in architecture today makes it crucial to mull over the comfort of a building's occupants solar control glass can be an eye-catching characteristic of a building whilst at the same time diminishing or even eradicating the need for an air-conditioning system reducing running costs of the building and saving energy solar control glass can be particular for any situation where unwarranted solar heat gain is likely to be a bother eg large façades glass walkways atria and conservatories
