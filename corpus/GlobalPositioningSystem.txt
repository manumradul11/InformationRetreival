the global positioning system gps is a space-based navigation system that provides location and time information in all weather conditions anywhere on or near the earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more gps satellites the system provides critical capabilities to military civil and commercial users around the world the united states government created the system maintains it and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a gps receiver
the us began the gps project in 1973 to overcome the limitations of previous navigation systems integrating ideas from several predecessors including a number of classified engineering design studies from the 1960s the us department of defense dod developed the system which originally used 24 satellites it became fully operational in 1995 roger l easton ivan a getting and bradford parkinson are credited with inventing itcitation needed
advances in technology and new demands on the existing system have now led to efforts to modernize the gps and implement the next generation of gps block iiia satellites and next generation operational control system ocx announcements from vice president al gore and the white house in 1998 initiated these changes in 2000 the us congress authorized the modernization effort gps iii
in addition to gps other systems are in use or under development the russian global navigation satellite system glonass was developed contemporaneously with gps but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s there are also the planned european union galileo positioning system india's indian regional navigation satellite system china's beidou navigation satellite system and the japanese quasi-zenith satellite system


the design of gps is based partly on similar ground-based radio-navigation systems such as loran and the decca navigator developed in the early 1940s and used by the british royal navy during world war ii
in 1956 the german-american physicist friedwardt winterberg proposed a test of general relativity — detecting time slowing in a strong gravitational field using accurate atomic clocks placed in orbit inside artificial satellites
special and general relativity predict that the clocks on the gps satellites would be seen by the earth's observers to run 38 microseconds faster per day than the clocks on the earth the gps calculated positions would quickly drift into error accumulating to 10 kilometers per day the relativistic time effect of the gps clocks running faster than the clocks on earth was corrected for in the design of gps
the soviet union launched the first man-made satellite sputnik 1 in 1957 two american physicists william guier and george weiffenbach at johns hopkins's applied physics laboratory apl decided to monitor sputnik's radio transmissions within hours they realized that because of the doppler effect they could pinpoint where the satellite was along its orbit the director of the apl gave them access to their univac to do the heavy calculations required
the next spring frank mcclure the deputy director of the apl asked guier and weiffenbach to investigate the inverse problem — pinpointing the user's location given that of the satellite at the time the navy was developing the submarine-launched polaris missile which required them to know the submarine's location this led them and apl to develop the transit system in 1959 arpa renamed darpa in 1972 also played a role in transit
the first satellite navigation system transit used by the united states navy was first successfully tested in 1960 it used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour
in 1967 the us navy developed the timation satellite that proved the ability to place accurate clocks in space a technology required by gps
in the 1970s the ground-based omega navigation system based on phase comparison of signal transmission from pairs of stations became the first worldwide radio navigation system limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy
while there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research development deployment and operation for a constellation of navigation satellites during the cold war arms race the nuclear threat to the existence of the united states was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the united states congress this deterrent effect is why gps was funded it is also the reason for the ultra secrecy at that time the nuclear triad consisted of the united states navy's submarine-launched ballistic missiles slbms along with united states air force usaf strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms considered vital to the nuclear deterrence posture accurate determination of the slbm launch position was a force multiplier
precise navigation would enable united states ballistic missile submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their slbms the usaf with two thirds of the nuclear triad also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system the navy and air force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem
to increase the survivability of icbms there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms such as russian ss-24 and ss-25 and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the slbm situation
in 1960 the air force proposed a radio-navigation system called mosaic mobile system for accurate icbm control that was essentially a 3-d loran a follow-on study project 57 was worked in 1963 and it was in this study that the gps concept was born that same year the concept was pursued as project 621b which had many of the attributes that you now see in gps and promised increased accuracy for air force bombers as well as icbms
updates from the navy transit system were too slow for the high speeds of air force operation the naval research laboratory continued advancements with their timation time navigation satellites first launched in 1967 and with the third one in 1974 carrying the first atomic clock into orbit
another important predecessor to gps came from a different branch of the united states military in 1964 the united states army orbited its first sequential collation of range secor satellite used for geodetic surveying the secor system included three ground-based transmitters from known locations that would send signals to the satellite transponder in orbit a fourth ground-based station at an undetermined position could then use those signals to fix its location precisely the last secor satellite was launched in 1969
decades later during the early years of gps civilian surveying became one of the first fields to make use of the new technology because surveyors could reap benefits of signals from the less-than-complete gps constellation years before it was declared operational gps can be thought of as an evolution of the secor system where the ground-based transmitters have been migrated into orbit
with these parallel developments in the 1960s it was realized that a superior system could be developed by synthesizing the best technologies from 621b transit timation and secor in a multi-service program
during labor day weekend in 1973 a meeting of about twelve military officers at the pentagon discussed the creation of a defense navigation satellite system dnss it was at this meeting that the real synthesis that became gps was created later that year the dnss program was named navstar or navigation system using timing and ranging with the individual satellites being associated with the name navstar as with the predecessors transit and timation a more fully encompassing name was used to identify the constellation of navstar satellites navstar-gps ten block i prototype satellites were launched between 1978 and 1985 with one prototype being destroyed in a launch failure
after korean air lines flight 007 a boeing 747 carrying 269 people was shot down in 1983 after straying into the ussr's prohibited airspace in the vicinity of sakhalin and moneron islands president ronald reagan issued a directive making gps freely available for civilian use once it was sufficiently developed as a common good the first block ii satellite was launched on february 14 1989 and the 24th satellite was launched in 1994 the gps program cost at this point not including the cost of the user equipment but including the costs of the satellite launches has been estimated at about usd$5 billion then-year dollars roger l easton is widely credited as the primary inventor of gps
initially the highest quality signal was reserved for military use and the signal available for civilian use was intentionally degraded selective availability this changed with president bill clinton signing a policy directive in 1996 to turn off selective availability in may 2000 to provide the same precision to civilians that was afforded to the military the directive was proposed by the us secretary of defense william perry because of the widespread growth of differential gps services to improve civilian accuracy and eliminate the us military advantage moreover the us military was actively developing technologies to deny gps service to potential adversaries on a regional basis
since its deployment the us has implemented several improvements to the gps service including new signals for civil use and increased accuracy and integrity for all users all the while maintaining compatibility with existing gps equipment modernization of the satellite system has been an ongoing initiative by the us department of defense through a series of satellite acquisitions to meet the growing needs of the military civilians and the commercial market
as of early 2015 high-quality faa grade standard positioning service sps gps receivers provide horizontal accuracy of better than 3.5 meters although many factors such as receiver quality and atmospheric issues can affect this accuracy
gps is owned and operated by the united states government as a national resource the department of defense is the steward of gps interagency gps executive board igeb oversaw gps policy matters from 1996 to 2004 after that the national space-based positioning navigation and timing executive committee was established by presidential directive in 2004 to advise and coordinate federal departments and agencies on matters concerning the gps and related systems the executive committee is chaired jointly by the deputy secretaries of defense and transportation its membership includes equivalent-level officials from the departments of state commerce and homeland security the joint chiefs of staff and nasa components of the executive office of the president participate as observers to the executive committee and the fcc chairman participates as a liaison
the us department of defense is required by law to maintain a standard positioning service as defined in the federal radio navigation plan and the standard positioning service signal specification that will be available on a continuous worldwide basis and develop measures to prevent hostile use of gps and its augmentations without unduly disrupting or degrading civilian uses

on february 10 1993 the national aeronautic association selected the gps team as winners of the 1992 robert j collier trophy the nation's most prestigious aviation award this team combines researchers from the naval research laboratory the usaf the aerospace corporation rockwell international corporation and ibm federal systems company the citation honors them for the most significant development for safe and efficient navigation and surveillance of air and spacecraft since the introduction of radio navigation 50 years ago
two gps developers received the national academy of engineering charles stark draper prize for 2003
gps developer roger l easton received the national medal of technology on february 13 2006
francis x kane col usaf ret was inducted into the us air force space and missile pioneers hall of fame at lackland afb san antonio texas march 2 2010 for his role in space technology development and the engineering design concept of gps conducted as part of project 621b
in 1998 gps technology was inducted into the space foundation space technology hall of fame
on october 4 2011 the international astronautical federation iaf awarded the global positioning system gps its 60th anniversary award nominated by iaf member the american institute for aeronautics and astronautics aiaa the iaf honors and awards committee recognized the uniqueness of the gps program and the exemplary role it has played in building international collaboration for the benefit of humanity
the gps concept is based on time and the known position of specialized satellites the satellites carry very stable atomic clocks that are synchronized to each other and to ground clocks any drift from true time maintained on the ground is corrected daily likewise the satellite locations are known with great precision gps receivers have clocks as well however they are not synchronized with true time and are less stable gps satellites continuously transmit their current time and position a gps receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the exact position of the receiver and its deviation from true time at a minimum four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time
each gps satellite continually broadcasts a signal carrier wave with modulation that includes
conceptually the receiver measures the toas according to its own clock of four satellite signals from the toas and the tots the receiver forms four time of flight tof values which are given the speed of light approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite range differences the receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four tofs
in practice the receiver position in three dimensional cartesian coordinates with origin at the earth's center and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the gps time are computed simultaneously using the navigation equations to process the tofs
the receiver's earth-centered solution location is usually converted to latitude longitude and height relative to an ellipsoidal earth model the height may then be further converted to height relative the geoid eg egm96 essentially mean sea level these coordinates may be displayed eg on a moving map display andor recorded andor used by some other system eg a vehicle guidance system
although usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing the conceptual time differences of arrival tdoas define the measurement geometry each tdoa corresponds to a hyperboloid of revolution see multilateration the line connecting the two satellites involved and its extensions forms the axis of the hyperboloid the receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect
it is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres while simpler to visualize this is only the case if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks ie the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences there are significant performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution if this were part of the gps system concept so that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock then a smaller number of satellites could be deployed however the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase significantly
the description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation most receivers have a track algorithm sometimes called a tracker that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times—in effect taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other after a set of measurements are processed the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements when the new measurements are collected the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction in general a tracker can a improve receiver position and time accuracy b reject bad measurements and c estimate receiver speed and direction
the disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can only be computed with a delay and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the random error of position measurement gps units can use measurements of the doppler shift of the signals received to compute velocity accurately more advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a compass or an inertial navigation system to complement gps
in typical gps operation as a navigator four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result the solution of the navigation equations gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock applications for gps such as time transfer traffic signal timing and synchronization of cell phone base stations make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing some gps applications use this time for display or other than for the basic position calculations do not use it at all
although four satellites are required for normal operation fewer apply in special cases if one variable is already known a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites for example a ship or aircraft may have known elevation some gps receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude dead reckoning inertial navigation or including information from the vehicle computer to give a possibly degraded position when fewer than four satellites are visible
the current gps consists of three major segments these are the space segment ss a control segment cs and a user segment us the us air force develops maintains and operates the space and control segments gps satellites broadcast signals from space and each gps receiver uses these signals to calculate its three-dimensional location latitude longitude and altitude and the current time
the space segment is composed of 24 to 32 satellites in medium earth orbit and also includes the payload adapters to the boosters required to launch them into orbit the control segment is composed of a master control station mcs an alternate master control station and a host of dedicated and shared ground antennas and monitor stations the user segment is composed of hundreds of thousands of us and allied military users of the secure gps precise positioning service and hundreds of millions of civil commercial and scientific users of the standard positioning service see gps navigation devices
the space segment ss is composed of the orbiting gps satellites or space vehicles sv in gps parlance the gps design originally called for 24 svs eight each in three approximately circular orbits but this was modified to six orbital planes with four satellites each the six orbit planes have approximately 55° inclination tilt relative to the earth's equator and are separated by 60° right ascension of the ascending node angle along the equator from a reference point to the orbit's intersection the orbital period is one-half a sidereal day ie 11 hours and 58 minutes so that the satellites pass over the same locations or almost the same locations every day the orbits are arranged so that at least six satellites are always within line of sight from almost everywhere on the earth's surface the result of this objective is that the four satellites are not evenly spaced 90 degrees apart within each orbit in general terms the angular difference between satellites in each orbit is 30 105 120 and 105 degrees apart which sum to 360 degrees
orbiting at an altitude of approximately 20200 km 12600 mi orbital radius of approximately 26600 km 16500 mi each sv makes two complete orbits each sidereal day repeating the same ground track each day this was very helpful during development because even with only four satellites correct alignment means all four are visible from one spot for a few hours each day for military operations the ground track repeat can be used to ensure good coverage in combat zones
as of december 2012update there are 32 satellites in the gps constellation the additional satellites improve the precision of gps receiver calculations by providing redundant measurements with the increased number of satellites the constellation was changed to a nonuniform arrangement such an arrangement was shown to improve reliability and availability of the system relative to a uniform system when multiple satellites fail about nine satellites are visible from any point on the ground at any one time see animation at right ensuring considerable redundancy over the minimum four satellites needed for a position
the control segment is composed of
the mcs can also access us air force satellite control network afscn ground antennas for additional command and control capability and nga national geospatial-intelligence agency monitor stations the flight paths of the satellites are tracked by dedicated us air force monitoring stations in hawaii kwajalein atoll ascension island diego garcia colorado springs colorado and cape canaveral along with shared nga monitor stations operated in england argentina ecuador bahrain australia and washington dc the tracking information is sent to the air force space command mcs at schriever air force base 25 km 16 mi ese of colorado springs which is operated by the 2nd space operations squadron 2 sops of the us air force then 2 sops contacts each gps satellite regularly with a navigational update using dedicated or shared afscn ground antennas gps dedicated ground antennas are located at kwajalein ascension island diego garcia and cape canaveral these updates synchronize the atomic clocks on board the satellites to within a few nanoseconds of each other and adjust the ephemeris of each satellite's internal orbital model the updates are created by a kalman filter that uses inputs from the ground monitoring stations space weather information and various other inputs
satellite maneuvers are not precise by gps standards—so to change a satellite's orbit the satellite must be marked unhealthy so receivers don't use it after the satellite maneuver engineers track the new orbit from the ground upload the new ephemeris and mark the satellite healthy again
the operation control segment ocs currently serves as the control segment of record it provides the operational capability that supports gps users and keeps the gps system operational and performing within specification
ocs successfully replaced the legacy 1970s-era mainframe computer at schriever air force base in september 2007 after installation the system helped enable upgrades and provide a foundation for a new security architecture that supported us armed forces ocs will continue to be the ground control system of record until the new segment next generation gps operation control system ocx is fully developed and functional
the new capabilities provided by ocx will be the cornerstone for revolutionizing gps's mission capabilities and enabling air force space command to greatly enhance gps operational services to us combat forces civil partners and myriad domestic and international users
the gps ocx program also will reduce cost schedule and technical risk it is designed to provide 50% sustainment cost savings through efficient software architecture and performance-based logistics in addition gps ocx is expected to cost millions less than the cost to upgrade ocs while providing four times the capability
the gps ocx program represents a critical part of gps modernization and provides significant information assurance improvements over the current gps ocs program
on september 14 2011 the us air force announced the completion of gps ocx preliminary design review and confirmed that the ocx program is ready for the next phase of development
the gps ocx program has missed major milestones and is pushing the gps iiia launch beyond april 2016citation needed
the user segment is composed of hundreds of thousands of us and allied military users of the secure gps precise positioning service and tens of millions of civil commercial and scientific users of the standard positioning service in general gps receivers are composed of an antenna tuned to the frequencies transmitted by the satellites receiver-processors and a highly stable clock often a crystal oscillator they may also include a display for providing location and speed information to the user a receiver is often described by its number of channels this signifies how many satellites it can monitor simultaneously originally limited to four or five this has progressively increased over the years so that as of 2007update receivers typically have between 12 and 20 channelsa
gps receivers may include an input for differential corrections using the rtcm sc-104 format this is typically in the form of an rs-232 port at 4800 bits speed data is actually sent at a much lower rate which limits the accuracy of the signal sent using rtcmcitation needed receivers with internal dgps receivers can outperform those using external rtcm datacitation needed as of 2006update even low-cost units commonly include wide area augmentation system waas receivers
many gps receivers can relay position data to a pc or other device using the nmea 0183 protocol although this protocol is officially defined by the national marine electronics association nmea references to this protocol have been compiled from public records allowing open source tools like gpsd to read the protocol without violating intellectual property lawsclarification needed other proprietary protocols exist as well such as the sirf and mtk protocols receivers can interface with other devices using methods including a serial connection usb or bluetooth
while originally a military project gps is considered a dual-use technology meaning it has significant military and civilian applications
gps has become a widely deployed and useful tool for commerce scientific uses tracking and surveillance gps's accurate time facilitates everyday activities such as banking mobile phone operations and even the control of power grids by allowing well synchronized hand-off switching
many civilian applications use one or more of gps's three basic components absolute location relative movement and time transfer
the us government controls the export of some civilian receivers all gps receivers capable of functioning above 18 km 60000 feet altitude and 515 ms 1000 knots or designed or modified for use with unmanned air vehicles like eg ballistic or cruise missile systems are classified as munitions weapons—which means they require state department export licenses
this rule applies even to otherwise purely civilian units that only receive the l1 frequency and the ca coarseacquisition code
disabling operation above these limits exempts the receiver from classification as a munition vendor interpretations differ the rule refers to operation at both the target altitude and speed but some receivers stop operating even when stationary this has caused problems with some amateur radio balloon launches that regularly reach 30 km 100000 feet
these limits only apply to units or components exported from the usa there is a growing trade in various components including gps units from other countries these are expressly sold as itar-free
as of 2009 military gps applications include
gps type navigation was first used in war in the 1991 persian gulf war before gps was fully developed in 1995 to assist coalition forces to navigate and perform maneuvers in the war the war also demonstrated the vulnerability of gps to being jammed when iraqi forces added noise to the weak gps signal transmission to protect iraqi targets
the navigational signals transmitted by gps satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions the state of the internal clocks and the health of the network these signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network two different encodings are used a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation and an encrypted encoding used by the us military
each gps satellite continuously broadcasts a navigation message on l1 ca and l2 py frequencies at a rate of 50 bits per second see bitrate each complete message takes 750 seconds 12 12 minutes to complete the message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes each subframe being 300 bits 6 seconds long subframes 4 and 5 are subcommutated 25 times each so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames each subframe consists of ten words each 30 bits long thus with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message each message is 37500 bits long at a transmission rate of 50-bits this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire almanac message gps each 30-second frame begins precisely on the minute or half-minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite
the first subframe of each frame encodes the week number and the time within the week as well as the data about the health of the satellite the second and the third subframes contain the ephemeris – the precise orbit for the satellite the fourth and fifth subframes contain the almanac which contains coarse orbit and status information for up to 32 satellites in the constellation as well as data related to error correction thus to obtain an accurate satellite location from this transmitted message the receiver must demodulate the message from each satellite it includes in its solution for 18 to 30 seconds to collect all transmitted almanacs the receiver must demodulate the message for 732 to 750 seconds or 12 12 minutes
all satellites broadcast at the same frequencies encoding signals using unique code division multiple access cdma so receivers can distinguish individual satellites from each other the system uses two distinct cdma encoding types the coarseacquisition ca code which is accessible by the general public and the precise py code which is encrypted so that only the us military and other nato nations who have been given access to the encryption code can access it
the ephemeris is updated every 2 hours and is generally valid for 4 hours with provisions for updates every 6 hours or longer in non-nominal conditions the almanac is updated typically every 24 hours additionally data for a few weeks following is uploaded in case of transmission updates that delay data uploadcitation needed
all satellites broadcast at the same two frequencies 1.57542 ghz l1 signal and 1.2276 ghz l2 signal the satellite network uses a cdma spread-spectrum techniquecitation needed where the low-bitrate message data is encoded with a high-rate pseudo-random prn sequence that is different for each satellite the receiver must be aware of the prn codes for each satellite to reconstruct the actual message data the ca code for civilian use transmits data at 1.023 million chips per second whereas the p code for us military use transmits at 10.23 million chips per second the actual internal reference of the satellites is 10.22999999543 mhz to compensate for relativistic effects that make observers on the earth perceive a different time reference with respect to the transmitters in orbit the l1 carrier is modulated by both the ca and p codes while the l2 carrier is only modulated by the p code the p code can be encrypted as a so-called py code that is only available to military equipment with a proper decryption key both the ca and py codes impart the precise time-of-day to the user
the l3 signal at a frequency of 1.38105 ghz is used to transmit data from the satellites to ground stations this data is used by the united states nuclear detonation nudet detection system usnds to detect locate and report nuclear detonations nudets in the earth's atmosphere and near space one usage is the enforcement of nuclear test ban treaties
the l4 band at 1.379913 ghz is being studied for additional ionospheric correctioncitation needed
the l5 frequency band at 1.17645 ghz was added in the process of gps modernization this frequency falls into an internationally protected range for aeronautical navigation promising little or no interference under all circumstances the first block iif satellite that provides this signal was launched in 2010 the l5 consists of two carrier components that are in phase quadrature with each other each carrier component is bi-phase shift key bpsk modulated by a separate bit train l5 the third civil gps signal will eventually support safety-of-life applications for aviation and provide improved availability and accuracy
a conditional waiver has recently been granted to lightsquared to operate a terrestrial broadband service near the l1 band although lightsquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment the fcc asked lightsquared to form a study group with the gps community to test gps receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the lightsquared terrestrial network the gps community had not objected to the lightsquared formerly msv and skyterra applications until november 2010 when lightsquared applied for a modification to its ancillary terrestrial component atc authorization this filing sat-mod-20101118-00239 amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a quiet neighborhood for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10 mhz of spectrum is minimal to gps devices less than 1% of the total gps devices are affected the upper 10 mhz intended for use by lightsquared may have some impact on gps devices there is some concern that this may seriously degrade the gps signal for many consumer uses aviation week magazine reports that the latest testing june 2011 confirms significant jamming of gps by lightsquared's system
because all of the satellite signals are modulated onto the same l1 carrier frequency the signals must be separated after demodulation this is done by assigning each satellite a unique binary sequence known as a gold code the signals are decoded after demodulation using addition of the gold codes corresponding to the satellites monitored by the receiver
if the almanac information has previously been acquired the receiver picks the satellites to listen for by their prns unique numbers in the range 1 through 32 if the almanac information is not in memory the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites to obtain a lock it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite the receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for as it detects each satellite's signal it identifies it by its distinct ca code pattern there can be a delay of up to 30 seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data
processing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time for more information see demodulation and decoding advanced
the receiver uses messages received from satellites to determine the satellite positions and time sent the x y and z components of satellite position and the time sent are designated as xi yi zi si where the subscript i denotes the satellite and has the value 1 2  n where n ≥ 4 when the time of message reception indicated by the on-board receiver clock is t̃i the true reception time is ti = t̃i − b where b is the receiver's clock bias from the much more accurate gps system clocks employed by the satellites the receiver clock bias is the same for all received satellite signals assuming the satellite clocks are all perfectly synchronized the message's transit time is t̃i − b − si where si is the satellite time assuming the message traveled at the speed of light c the distance traveled is t̃i − b − si c
for n satellites the equations to satisfy are
or in terms of pseudoranges  as
since the equations have four unknowns x y z b—the three components of gps receiver position and the clock bias—signals from at least four satellites are necessary to attempt solving these equations they can be solved by algebraic or numerical methods existence and uniqueness of gps solutions are discussed by abell and chaffee when n is greater than 4 this system is overdetermined and a fitting method must be used
with each combination of satellites gdop quantities can be calculated based on the relative sky directions of the satellites used the receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system such as latitude and longitude using the wgs 84 geodetic datum or a country-specific system
the gps equations can be solved by numerical and analytical methods geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods
the measured ranges called pseudoranges contain clock errors in a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized these true ranges represent the radii of spheres each centered on one of the transmitting satellites the solution for the position of the receiver is then at the intersection of the surfaces of three of these spheres if more than the minimum number of ranges is available a near intersection of more than three sphere surfaces could be found via eg least squares
if the distance traveled between the receiver and satellite i and the distance traveled between the receiver and satellite j are subtracted the result is t̃i − si c − t̃j − sj c which only involves known or measured quantities the locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points here two satellites is a hyperboloid see multilateration thus from four or more measured reception times the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three or more hyperboloids
the solution space x y z b can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space in that case each of the equations describes a spherical cone with the cusp located at the satellite and the base a sphere around the satellite the receiver is at the intersection of four or more of such cones
when more than four satellites are available the calculation can use the four best or more than four simultaneously up to all visible satellites depending on the number of receiver channels processing capability and geometric dilution of precision gdop
using more than four involves an over-determined system of equations with no unique solution such a system can be solved by a least-squares or weighted least squares method
both the equations for four satellites or the least squares equations for more than four are non-linear and need special solution methods a common approach is by iteration on a linearized form of the equations eg gauss–newton algorithm
the gps system was initially developed assuming use of a numerical least-squares solution method—ie before closed-form solutions were found
one closed-form solution to the above set of equations was developed by s bancroft its properties are well known in particular proponents claim it is superior in low-gdop situations compared to iterative least squares methods
bancroft's method is algebraic as opposed to numerical and can be used for four or more satellites when four satellites are used the key steps are inversion of a 4x4 matrix and solution of a single-variable quadratic equation bancroft's method provides one or two solutions for the unknown quantities when there are two usually the case only one is a near-earth sensible solution
when a receiver uses more than four satellites for a solution bancroft uses the generalized inverse ie the pseudoinverse to find a solution however a case has been made that iterative methods eg gauss–newton algorithm for solving over-determined non-linear least squares nlls problems generally provide more accurate solutions
leick et al 2015 states that bancroft's 1985 solution is a very early if not the first closed-form solution other closed-form solutions were published afterwards although their adoption in practice is unclear
gps error analysis examines error sources in gps results and the expected size of those errors gps makes corrections for receiver clock errors and other effects but some residual errors remain uncorrected error sources include signal arrival time measurements numerical calculations atmospheric effects ionospherictropospheric delays ephemeris and clock data multipath signals and natural and artificial interference magnitude of residual errors from these sources depends on geometric dilution of precision artificial errors may result from jamming devices and threaten ships and aircraft or from intentional signal degradation through selective availability which limited accuracy to ~6–12 m but has been switched off since may 1 2000
integrating external information into the calculation process can materially improve accuracy such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives some systems transmit additional error information such as clock drift ephemera or ionospheric delay others characterize prior errors while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information
examples of augmentation systems include the wide area augmentation system waas european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos differential gps dgps inertial navigation systems ins and assisted gps the standard accuracy of about 15 meters 49 feet can be augmented to 3–5 meters 9.8–16.4 ft with dgps and to about 3 meters 9.8 feet with waas
accuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing gps signals in additional or alternate ways
the largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the ionosphere the spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters but some errors remain this is one reason gps spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies l1 and l2 ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the total electron content tec along the path so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines tec and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency
military receivers can decode the py code transmitted on both l1 and l2 without decryption keys it is still possible to use a codeless technique to compare the py codes on l1 and l2 to gain much of the same error information however this technique is slow so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment in the future additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the l2 and l5 frequencies see gps modernization all users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors
a second form of precise monitoring is called carrier-phase enhancement cpgps this corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the prn is not instantaneous and thus the correlation satellite–receiver sequence matching operation is imperfect cpgps uses the l1 carrier wave which has a period of  which is about one-thousandth of the ca gold code bit period of  to act as an additional clock signal and resolve the uncertainty the phase difference error in the normal gps amounts to 2–3 meters 7–10 ft of ambiguity cpgps working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to 3 centimeters 1.2 in of ambiguity by eliminating this error source cpgps coupled with dgps normally realizes between 20–30 centimeters 8–12 in of absolute accuracy
relative kinematic positioning rkp is a third alternative for a precise gps-based positioning system in this approach determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than 10 centimeters 4 in this is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential gps dgps correction data transmitting gps signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests—possibly with processing in real-time real-time kinematic positioning rtk
while most clocks derive their time from coordinated universal time utc the atomic clocks on the satellites are set to gps time gpst see the page of united states naval observatory the difference is that gps time is not corrected to match the rotation of the earth so it does not contain leap seconds or other corrections that are periodically added to utc gps time was set to match utc in 1980 but has since diverged the lack of corrections means that gps time remains at a constant offset with international atomic time tai tai − gps = 19 seconds periodic corrections are performed to the on-board clocks to keep them synchronized with ground clocks
the gps navigation message includes the difference between gps time and utc as of july 2015 gps time is 17 seconds ahead of utc because of the leap second added to utc on june 30 2015 receivers subtract this offset from gps time to calculate utc and specific timezone values new gps units may not show the correct utc time until after receiving the utc offset message the gps-utc offset field can accommodate 255 leap seconds eight bits
gps time is theoretically accurate to about 14 nanoseconds however most receivers lose accuracy in the interpretation of the signals and are only accurate to 100 nanoseconds
as opposed to the year month and day format of the gregorian calendar the gps date is expressed as a week number and a seconds-into-week number the week number is transmitted as a ten-bit field in the ca and py navigation messages and so it becomes zero again every 1024 weeks 19.6 years gps week zero started at 000000 utc 000019 tai on january 6 1980 and the week number became zero again for the first time at 235947 utc on august 21 1999 000019 tai on august 22 1999 to determine the current gregorian date a gps receiver must be provided with the approximate date to within 3584 days to correctly translate the gps date signal to address this concern the modernized gps navigation message uses a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8192 weeks 157 years thus lasting until the year 2137 157 years after gps week zero
another method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking the period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength which is about 0.19 meters for the l1 carrier accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as 2 millimeters this compares to 3 meters for the ca code and 0.3 meters for the p code
however 2 millimeter accuracy requires measuring the total phase—the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength which requires specially equipped receivers this method has many surveying applications it is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of tectonic plates typically 0–100 mm 0–4 inches per year
triple differencing followed by numerical root finding and a mathematical technique called least squares can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another first compute the difference between satellites then between receivers and finally between epochs other orders of taking differences are equally valid detailed discussion of the errors is omitted
the satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles let denote the phase of the carrier of satellite j measured by receiver i at time  this notation shows the meaning of the subscripts i j and k the receiver r satellite s and time t come in alphabetical order as arguments of and to balance readability and conciseness let be a concise abbreviation also we define three functions  which return differences between receivers satellites and time points respectively each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments these three functions are defined below if is a function of the three integer arguments i j and k then it is a valid argument for the functions  with the values defined as
also if are valid arguments for the three functions and a and b are constants then is a valid argument with values defined as
receiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite 1 with that from satellite 2 at the same epoch this difference is designated as
double differencing computes the difference of receiver 1's satellite difference from that of receiver 2 this approximately eliminates satellite clock errors this double difference is
triple differencing subtracts the receiver difference from time 1 from that of time 2 this eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced this triple difference is
triple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables for example if the position of receiver 1 is known but the position of receiver 2 unknown it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver 2 using numerical root finding and least squares triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver 2's three position components this may require a numerical procedure an approximation of receiver 2's position is required to use such a numerical method this initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver 2's position processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions least squares can estimate an overdetermined system least squares determines the position of receiver 2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver 2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares
in the united states gps receivers are regulated under the federal communications commission's fcc part 15 rules as indicated in the manuals of gps-enabled devices sold in the united states as a part 15 device it must accept any interference received including interference that may cause undesired operation with respect to gps devices in particular the fcc states that gps receiver manufacturers must use receivers that reasonably discriminate against reception of signals outside their allocated spectrum for the last 30 years gps receivers have operated next to the mobile satellite service band and have discriminated against reception of mobile satellite services such as inmarsat without any issue
the spectrum allocated for gps l1 use by the fcc is 1559 to 1610 mhz while the spectrum allocated for satellite-to-ground use owned by lightsquared is the mobile satellite service band since 1996 the fcc has authorized licensed use of the spectrum neighboring the gps band of 1525 to 1559 mhz to the virginia company lightsquared on march 1 2001 the fcc received an application from lightsquared's predecessor motient services to use their allocated frequencies for an integrated satellite-terrestrial service in 2002 the us gps industry council came to an out-of-band-emissions oobe agreement with lightsquared to prevent transmissions from lightsquared's ground-based stations from emitting transmissions into the neighboring gps band of 1559 to 1610 mhz in 2004 the fcc adopted the oobe agreement in its authorization for lightsquared to deploy a ground-based network ancillary to their satellite system – known as the ancillary tower components atcs – we will authorize mss atc subject to conditions that ensure that the added terrestrial component remains ancillary to the principal mss offering we do not intend nor will we permit the terrestrial component to become a stand-alone service  this authorization was reviewed and approved by the us interdepartment radio advisory committee which includes the us department of agriculture us air force us army us coast guard federal aviation administration national aeronautics and space administration interior and us department of transportation
in january 2011 the fcc conditionally authorized lightsquared's wholesale customers—such as best buy sharp and c spire—to only purchase an integrated satellite-ground-based service from lightsquared and re-sell that integrated service on devices that are equipped to only use the ground-based signal using lightsquared's allocated frequencies of 1525 to 1559 mhz in december 2010 gps receiver manufacturers expressed concerns to the fcc that lightsquared's signal would interfere with gps receiver devices although the fcc's policy considerations leading up to the january 2011 order did not pertain to any proposed changes to the maximum number of ground-based lightsquared stations or the maximum power at which these stations could operate the january 2011 order makes final authorization contingent upon studies of gps interference issues carried out by a lightsquared led working group along with gps industry and federal agency participation on february 14 2012 the fcc initiated proceedings to vacate lightsquared's conditional waiver order based on the ntia's conclusion that there was currently no practical way to mitigate potential gps interference
gps receiver manufacturers design gps receivers to use spectrum beyond the gps-allocated band in some cases gps receivers are designed to use up to 400 mhz of spectrum in either direction of the l1 frequency of 1575.42 mhz because mobile satellite services in those regions are broadcasting from space to ground and at power levels commensurate with mobile satellite services however as regulated under the fcc's part 15 rules gps receivers are not warranted protection from signals outside gps-allocated spectrum this is why gps operates next to the mobile satellite service band and also why the mobile satellite service band operates next to gps the symbiotic relationship of spectrum allocation ensures that users of both bands are able to operate cooperatively and freely
the fcc adopted rules in february 2003 that allowed mobile satellite service mss licensees such as lightsquared to construct a small number of ancillary ground-based towers in their licensed spectrum to promote more efficient use of terrestrial wireless spectrum in those 2003 rules the fcc stated as a preliminary matter terrestrial commercial mobile radio service cmrs and mss atc are expected to have different prices coverage product acceptance and distribution therefore the two services appear at best to be imperfect substitutes for one another that would be operating in predominately different market segments mss atc is unlikely to compete directly with terrestrial cmrs for the same customer base in 2004 the fcc clarified that the ground-based towers would be ancillary noting that we will authorize mss atc subject to conditions that ensure that the added terrestrial component remains ancillary to the principal mss offering we do not intend nor will we permit the terrestrial component to become a stand-alone service in july 2010 the fcc stated that it expected lightsquared to use its authority to offer an integrated satellite-terrestrial service to provide mobile broadband services similar to those provided by terrestrial mobile providers and enhance competition in the mobile broadband sector however gps receiver manufacturers have argued that lightsquared's licensed spectrum of 1525 to 1559 mhz was never envisioned as being used for high-speed wireless broadband based on the 2003 and 2004 fcc atc rulings making clear that the ancillary tower component atc would be in fact ancillary to the primary satellite component to build public support of efforts to continue the 2004 fcc authorization of lightsquared's ancillary terrestrial component vs a simple ground-based lte service in the mobile satellite service band gps receiver manufacturer trimble navigation ltd formed the coalition to save our gps
the fcc and lightsquared have each made public commitments to solve the gps interference issue before the network is allowed to operate however according to chris dancy of the aircraft owners and pilots association airline pilots with the type of systems that would be affected may go off course and not even realize it the problems could also affect the federal aviation administration upgrade to the air traffic control system united states defense department guidance and local emergency services including 911
on february 14 2012 the us federal communications commission fcc moved to bar lightsquared's planned national broadband network after being informed by the national telecommunications and information administration ntia the federal agency that coordinates spectrum uses for the military and other federal government entities that there is no practical way to mitigate potential interference at this time lightsquared is challenging the fcc's action
