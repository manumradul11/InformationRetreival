graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the correct use of typography space image and color
the field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design but sometimes the term graphic design is used interchangeably with these due to overlapping skills involved graphic designers use various methods to create and combine words symbols and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages a graphic designer may use a combination of typography visual arts and page layout techniques to produce a final result graphic design often refers to both the process designing by which the communication is created and the products designs which are generated
common uses of graphic design include identity logos and branding publications magazines newspapers and books print advertisements posters billboards website graphics and elements signs and product packaging for example a product package might include a logo or other artwork organized text and pure design elements such as images shapes and color which unify the piece composition is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements


while graphic design as a discipline has a relatively recent history first coined by william addison dwiggins in 1922 graphic design-like activities span the history of humankind from the caves of lascaux to rome's trajan's column to the illuminated manuscripts of the middle ages to the dazzling neons of ginza in truth babylon artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction the bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch the builder or some other dignitary arguably this could have been identified as the first billboard or road signs announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city today the egyptians developed a key communication by hieroglyphics which used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 bc found on the rosetta stone the rosetta stone found by one of napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the egyptian ruler ptolemy as the true son of the sun the father of the moon and the keeper of the happiness of men  further the egyptians also brought the invention of papyrus paper made from reeds found along the nile on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time between the dates of 500ad and 1450 ad also known as the dark ages it was the monks that kept the symbols and writings alive when much of the citizenry were stagnated in progressive learning in reading and writing in both this lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries there is sometimes a blurring distinction and overlapping of advertising art graphic design and fine art after all they share many of the same elements theories principles practices and languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client in advertising art the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services in graphic design the essence is to give order to information form to ideas expression and feeling to artifacts that document human experience the history even as far back as benjamin franklin who use this paper the pennsylvania gazette in 1728 he mastered the art of publicity not only did he promote his own books he used it to influence what he thought the masses should read as well benjamin franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in pennsylvania andrew bradford as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted as copywriter and therefore won he showed his prowess by running an ad in his general magazine and the historical chronicle of british plantations in america the precursor to the saturday evening post that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented named called the pennsylvania fireplace which is still sold today and is known as the franklin stove  american advertising was as american as primitive plumbing as it imitated british newspapers and magazines news papers offered 3 block of telling societyor the slaves that ran away from their masters advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines which made it difficult to read it was benjamin franklin that changed this by adding 14 point heading of the first line of the advertisement although later it was shortened and centered making a real heading franklin's use of type was masterful e instinctively knew what appealed to the eye it was franklin that added illustrations which was something that not even london printers had done and was considered most advanced benjamin franklin was the first to invent logos which were early symbols that announced such advertisements as opticians with golden spectacles benjamin franklin taught the advertisers that the use of detail was important to tell the story of their products the idea of telling a story grew a monster as some began advertising in 10-20 lines adding color names varieties and sizes of the goods they offered the early advertisements tell us a lot about the culture the thoughts and conditions that the colonists faced during the establishment of this great nation in its advertising infancy
a man named phillip miller placed an ad in the pennsylvania gazette may 1 1776 which read
 came to my plantation in springfield township philadelphia county near flour-town the 26th of march 1776 a strange red cow the owner may have her again on proving his property and paying charges 
one of the first ads for lost and found articles were as follows
lost on the 10 of april last off of mr shippen's warff in boston two iron anvils weighing between 120 and 140 pounds whoever has taken them up and will bring or give true intelligence of them to john campbell post master shall have a sufficient reward it was the publisher that had the responsibility to pay rewards for lost and found articles i like you are wondering who would steal something that heavy and where would they keep it and why?
this example was one of personal advertisements which often blended great humor
march 8 1866- marriage-a gentleman young with a fair portion of cash and very large expectations desires to make some food and handsome girl his wife her happiness will be his own and the sincere object of marital relations money no object but youth indispensable old maids widows and ugly women over 18 need not to respond to ye man herald office

female advertisers were not illusive either
december 21 1861 in the new york herald  a young lady country bred but easily tamed and civilized would like to correspond with a city gentleman with a view to matrimony it is necessary for him to be wealthy and not less than forty years of age as she would rather be an old man's darling than a young man's slavethe advertiser is 21 and presumes her manners and appearance will recommend her to tastes not over fastidious also a lady of position will expect replies from responsible parties only therefore triflers take heed address matilda station d post office
the 17th and 18th century advertising moved into trading cards which had proceeded handwritten announcements being pasted on the walls of establishments this became so widespread and as space was short that new announcements were being pasted directly over others that had been slapped up only minutes before this was the precursor to today's advertising code of ethics it started as an agreement that no ad would be posted over another if the paste was still damp this form of paste dried very slowly these ads only gained about a few days worth of exposure
there were clear examples of bias in classified ads early on in many disparaging notices placed by masters of slaves and husbands when their slaves or wives ran away the advertisers were not bound by codes of ethics but only through society as it was through the earliest collections truth was in between the words that were used however the ads of the time did give an accurate picture of society and a way to keep them accountable among themselves the habits practices and principles are engraved in advertising and through the tour of the past advertisements we reunite with the ages past colonial merchants like merchants of today go where the customers were the trading post was the store and the peddler a walking catalog a quote by frederic farrar historian and newspaper salesman stated in october 1975 that  without newspapers there would have been no american revolution and without advertising there would have been no newspaper

jan tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book new typography he later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as being fascistic but it remained very influentialcitation needed tschichold bauhaus typographers such as herbert bayer and lászló moholy-nagy and el lissitzky have greatly influenced graphic design as we know it today they pioneered production techniquescitation needed and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century the following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application a booming post-world war ii american economy established a greater need for graphic design mainly advertising and packaging the emigration of the german bauhaus school of design to chicago in 1937 brought a mass-produced minimalism to america sparking a wild fire of modern architecture and design notable names in mid-century modern design include adrian frutiger designer of the typefaces univers and frutiger paul rand who from the late 1930s until his death in 1996 took the principles of the bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design helping to create a uniquely american approach to european minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as corporate identity and josef müller-brockmann who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era
the growth of the professional graphic design industry has grown in parallel with the rise of consumerism this has raised some concerns and criticisms notably from within the graphic design community with the first things first manifesto first launched by ken garland in 1964 it was re-published as the first things first 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine emigre 51 stating we propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning the scope of debate is shrinking it must expand consumerism is running uncontested it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed in part through the visual languages and resources of design both editions attracted signatures from respected design practitioners and thinkers for example rudy vanderlans erik spiekermann ellen lupton and rick poynor the 2000 manifesto was also notably published in adbusters known for its strong critiques of visual culture
from road signs to technical schematics from interoffice memorandums to reference manuals graphic design enhances transfer of knowledge and visual messages readability and legibility is enhanced by improving the visual presentation and layout of text
design can also aid in selling a product or idea through effective visual communication it is applied to products and elements of company identity like logos colors packaging and text together these are defined as branding see also advertising branding has increasingly become important in the range of services offered by many graphic designers alongside corporate identity whilst the terms are often used interchangeably branding is more strictly related to the identifying mark or trade name for a product or service whereas corporate identity can have a broader meaning relating to the structure and ethos of a company as well as to the company's external image graphic designers will often form part of a team working on corporate identity and branding projects other members of that team can include marketing professionals communications consultants and commercial writers
textbooks are designed to present subjects such as geography science and math these publications have layouts which illustrate theories and diagrams a common example of graphics in use to educate is diagrams of human anatomy graphic design is also applied to layout and formatting of educational material to make the information more accessible and more readily understandable
graphic wayfinding signage systems have become important for large public spaces such as airports and convention centers these systems often depend on graphic design to communicate information quickly and economically through a color or symbol that can be read and followed from a distance as opposed to large amounts of text such environmental graphic design systems allow people to navigate unfamiliar spaces the term architectural graphics was coined by jane davis doggett pioneer designer of airport wayfinding systems but the term more commonly used in 2014 is environmental graphics
graphic design is applied in the entertainment industry in decoration scenery and visual story telling other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels comic books dvd covers opening credits and closing credits in filmmaking and programs and props on stage this could also include artwork used for t-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale
from scientific journals to news reporting the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as information design newspapers magazines blogs television and film documentaries may use graphic design to inform and entertain with the advent of the web information designers with experience in interactive tools such as adobe flash are increasingly being used to illustrate the background to news stories
a graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing text and either preexisting imagery or images developed by the graphic designer artistic pieces can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form which involves the use of visual arts typography and page layout techniques for publications and marketing for example a newspaper story begins with the journalists and photojournalists and then becomes the graphic designer's job to organize the page into a reasonable layout and determine if any other graphic elements should be required in a magazine article or advertisement often the graphic designer or art director will commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces just to be incorporated into the design layout or the designer may utilize stock imagery or photography contemporary design practice has been extended to the modern computer for example in the use of wysiwyg user interfaces often referred to as interactive design or multimedia design another aspect of graphic design is to have good research skills analyzing a work of art and simultaneously seeing it in new ways graphic design need skills such as power to convince the audience and selling the design communication is a key part in graphic design the process of graphic design include the process school which is an approach to the subject that is concerned with the actual process of communication it especially highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode semiotic school on the other hand is message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers produces meaning communication as an agent the process school is like the way in which a message is brought out to society
before any graphic elements may be applied to a design the graphic elements must be originated by means of visual art skills these graphics are often but not always developed by a graphic designer visual arts include works which are primarily visual in nature using anything from traditional media to photography or digital art graphic design principles may be applied to each graphic art element individually as well as to the final composition
typography is the art craft and techniques of type design modifying type glyphs and arranging type type glyphs characters are created and modified using a variety of illustration techniques the arrangement of type is the selection of typefaces point size tracking the space between all characters used kerning the space between two specific characters and leading line spacing
typography is performed by typesetters compositors typographers graphic artists art directors and clerical workers until the digital age typography was a specialized occupation digitization opened up typography to new generations of visual designers and lay users

the page layout aspect of graphic design deals with the arrangement of elements content on a page such as image placement and text layout and style beginning from early illuminated pages in hand-copied books of the middle ages and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalogue layouts structured page design has long been a consideration in printed material and more recently in electronic displays such as web pages elements usually consist of type text images pictures and with print media occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as dielaser cutting foil stamping or blind embossing
printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on paper and other materials or surfaces except in the case of monotyping the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece which is called a print each piece is not a copy but an original since it is not a reproduction of another work of art and is technically known as an impression painting or drawing on the other hand creates a unique original piece of artwork prints are created from a single original surface known technically as a matrix common types of matrices include plates of metal usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching stone used for lithography blocks of wood for woodcuts linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing but there are many other kinds discussed below works printed from a single plate create an edition in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition prints may also be published in book form as artist's books a single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques
nearly all design problems share some fundamental aspects typefaces will need to be selected or photographs arranged in an interesting way across a layout regardless of specific concerns that may need to be addressed in a particular project there are general strategies most designers will use as foundations for more complex visual concepts or to ensure common notions of quality are met in the final presentation
the mind is an important graphic design tool aside from technology graphic design requires judgment and creativity critical observational quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and rendering if the executor is merely following a solution eg sketch script or instructions provided by another designer such as an art director then the executor is not usually considered the designer
the method of presentation eg arrangement style medium may be equally important to the design the appropriate development and presentation tools can substantially change how an audience perceives a project the image or layout is produced using external traditional media and guides or digital image editing tools on computers tools in computer graphics often take on traditional names such as scissors or pen some graphic design tools such as a grid are used in both traditional and digital form
in the mid-1980s the arrival of desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced a generation of designers to computer image manipulation and creation that had previously been manually executed computer graphic design enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes and to simulate the effects of traditional media without requiring a lot of space however traditional tools such as pencils or markers are useful even when computers are used for finalization a designer or art director may hand sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process some of these sketches may even be shown to a client for early stage approval before the designer develops the idea further using a computer and graphic design software tools
computers are considered an indispensable tool in the graphic design industry computers and software applications are generally seen by creative professionals as more effective production tools than traditional methods however some designers continue to use manual and traditional tools for production such as milton glaser
new ideas can come by way of experimenting with tools and methods some designers explore ideas using pencil and paper others use many different mark-making tools and resources from computers to sculpture as a means of inspiring creativity one of the key features of graphic design is that it makes a tool out of appropriate image selection in order to possibly convey meaning
there is some debate whether computers enhance the creative process of graphic design rapid production from the computer allows many designers to explore multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by traditional hand-rendering or paste-up on paper moving the designer through the creative process more quickly however being faced with limitless choices does not help isolate the best design solution and can lead to endless iterations with no clear design outcome
a graphic designer may use sketches to explore multiple or complex ideas quickly without the distractions and complications of softwarecitation needed hand-rendered comps are often used to get approval for an idea execution before a designer invests time to produce finished visuals on a computer or in paste-up the same thumbnail sketches or rough drafts on paper may be used to rapidly refine and produce the idea on the computer in a hybrid process this hybrid process is especially useful in logo design where a software learning curve may detract from a creative thought process the traditional-designcomputer-production hybrid process may be used for freeing one's creativity in page layout or image development as wellcitation needed in the early days of computer publishing many traditional graphic designers relied on computer-savvy production artists to produce their ideas from sketches without needing to learn the computer skills themselves however this practice has been increasingly less common since the advent of desktop publishing over 30 years ago the use of computers and graphics software is now taught in most graphic design courses
nearly all of the popular and industry standard software programs used for graphic design since the early 1990s are products of adobe systems incorporated they are adobe photoshop a raster-based program for photo editing adobe illustrator a vector-based program for draw are often used in the final stage of the electronic design process raster images may have been edited in adobe photoshop logos and illustrations in adobe illustrator and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs most graphic designers entering the field since about 1990 are expected to be proficient in at least one or two of these programs
since the advent of the world wide web and computer software development many graphic designers have become involved in interface design in an environment commonly referred to as a graphical user interface gui this has included web design and software design when end user interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface combining visual communication skills with the interactive communication skills of user interaction and online branding graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create both the look and feel of a web site or software application and enhance the interactive experience of the user or web site visitor an important aspect of interface design is icon design
user experience design considers how a user interacts with and responds to an interface service or product and adjusts it accordingly
experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the build environment this area of graphic design requires practitioners to possess knowledge of creating large scale physical installations which have to be manufactured and withstand the same sort of environmental conditions as buildings as such it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers fabricators city planners architects manufacturers and large project building teams
experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding placemaking branded environments exhibitions and museum displays public installations and digital environments
graphic design career paths cover all ends of the creative spectrum and often overlap employment within graphic design involves workers performing specialized tasks such as design services publishing advertising and public relations while receiving a median pay of $44150.00 per year the main job responsibility of a graphic designer is the arrangement of visual elements in some type of media the main job titles within the industry can vary and are often country specific they can include graphic designer art director creative director animator and the entry level production artist depending on the industry served the responsibilities may have different titles such as dtp associate or graphic artist but despite changes in title graphic design principles remain consistent the responsibilities may come from or lead to specialized skills such as illustration photography animation or interactive design today's graduating graphic design students are normally exposed to all of these areas of graphic design and urged to become familiar with all of them as well in order to be competitive graphic designers will face strong competition when applying for positions in which organizations are looking for candidates with convincing talents and a college-level education field requirements consist of having strong portfolio and a bachelor's degree due to the increase in technology employment rates within computer systems design are expecting a 35% increase while traditional designs such as publications are facing slower rates of 16% or less
graphic designers can work in a variety of environments whilst many will work within companies devoted specifically to the industry such as design consultancies or branding agencies others may work within publishing marketing or other communications companies increasingly especially since the introduction of personal computers to the industry many graphic designers have found themselves working within non-design oriented organizations as in-house designers graphic designers may also work as free-lance designers working on their own terms prices ideas etc
a graphic designer reports to the art director creative director or senior media creative as a designer becomes more senior they may spend less time designing media and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities such as brand development and corporate identity development they are often expected to interact more directly with clients for example taking and interpreting briefs
jeff howe of wired magazine first used the term crowdsourcing in his 2006 article the rise of crowdsourcing creative work spans creative domains such as graphic design crowdsourcing architecture apparel design writing illustration tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent an example of a divergent task is generating a large number of designs for a poster an example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design
