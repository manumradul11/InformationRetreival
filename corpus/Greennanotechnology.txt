green nanotechnology refers to the use of nanotechnology to enhance the environmental sustainability of processes producing negative externalities it also refers to the use of the products of nanotechnology to enhance sustainability it includes making green nano-products and using nano-products in support of sustainability
green nanotechnology has been described as the development of clean technologies to minimize potential environmental and human health risks associated with the manufacture and use of nanotechnology products and to encourage replacement of existing products with new nano-products that are more environmentally friendly throughout their lifecycle


green nanotechnology has two goals producing nanomaterials and products without harming the environment or human health and producing nano-products that provide solutions to environmental problems it uses existing principles of green chemistry and green engineering to make nanomaterials and nano-products without toxic ingredients at low temperatures using less energy and renewable inputs wherever possible and using lifecycle thinking in all design and engineering stages
in addition to making nanomaterials and products with less impact to the environment green nanotechnology also means using nanotechnology to make current manufacturing processes for non-nano materials and products more environmentally friendly for example nanoscale membranes can help separate desired chemical reaction products from waste materials nanoscale catalysts can make chemical reactions more efficient and less wasteful sensors at the nanoscale can form a part of process control systems working with nano-enabled information systems using alternative energy systems made possible by nanotechnology is another way to green manufacturing processes
the second goal of green nanotechnology involves developing products that benefit the environment either directly or indirectly nanomaterials or products directly can clean hazardous waste sites desalinate water treat pollutants or sense and monitor environmental pollutants indirectly lightweight nanocomposites for automobiles and other means of transportation could save fuel and reduce materials used for production nanotechnology-enabled fuel cells and light-emitting diodes leds could reduce pollution from energy generation and help conserve fossil fuels self-cleaning nanoscale surface coatings could reduce or eliminate many cleaning chemicals used in regular maintenance routines and enhanced battery life could lead to less material use and less waste green nanotechnology takes a broad systems view of nanomaterials and products ensuring that unforeseen consequences are minimized and that impacts are anticipated throughout the full life cycle
one major project that is being worked on is the development of nanotechnology in solar cells solar cells are more efficient as they get tinier and solar energy is a renewable resource the price per watt of solar energy is lower than one dollar
nanotechnology is already used to provide improved performance coatings for photovoltaic pv and solar thermal panels hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties combine to create more efficient solar panels especially during inclement weather pv covered with nanotechnology coatings are said to stay cleaner for longer to ensure maximum energy efficiency is maintained
nanotechnology offers the potential of novel nanomaterials for the treatment of surface water groundwater wastewater and other environmental materials contaminated by toxic metal ions organic and inorganic solutes and microorganisms due to their unique activity toward recalcitrant contaminants many nanomaterials are under active research and development for use in the treatment of water and contaminated sites
the present market of nanotech-based technologies applied in water treatment consists of reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration membranes indeed among emerging products one can name nanofiber filters carbon nanotubes and various nanoparticles nanotechnology is expected to deal more efficiently with contaminants which convectional water treatment systems struggle to treat including bacteria viruses and heavy metals this efficiency generally stems from the very high specific surface area of nanomaterials which increases dissolution reactivity and sorption of contaminants
some potential applications include
scientists have been researching the capabilities of buckminsterfullerene in controlling pollution as it may be able to control certain chemical reactions buckminsterfullerene has been demonstrated as having the ability of inducing the protection of reactive oxygen species and causing lipid peroxidation this material may allow for hydrogen fuel to be more accessible to consumers
