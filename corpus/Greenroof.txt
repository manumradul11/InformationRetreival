a green roof or living roof is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium planted over a waterproofing membrane it may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems container gardens on roofs where plants are maintained in pots are not generally considered to be true green roofs although this is debated rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat greywater
green roofs serve several purposes for a building such as absorbing rainwater providing insulation creating a habitat for wildlife increasing benevolence and decreasing stress of the people around the roof by providing a more aesthetically pleasing landscape and helping to lower urban air temperatures and mitigate the heat island effect they effectively utilize the natural functions of plants to filter water and treat air in urban and suburban landscapes there are two types of green roof intensive roofs which are thicker with a minimum depth of 12.8 cm 5.0 in and can support a wider variety of plants but are heavier and require more maintenance and extensive roofs which are shallow ranging in depth from 2 cm 0.79 in to 12.7 cm 5.0 in lighter than intensive green roofs and require minimal maintenance
the term green roof may also be used to indicate roofs that use some form of green technology such as a cool roof a roof with solar thermal collectors or photovoltaic panels green roofs are also referred to as eco-roofs oikosteges vegetated roofs living roofs greenroofs and vcph horizontal vegetated complex partitions


green roofs are used to
a 2005 study by brad bass of the university of toronto showed that green roofs can also reduce heat loss and energy consumption in winter conditions
—a study presented at the green roofs for healthy cities conference in june 2004 cited by the epa found water runoff was reduced by over 75% during rainstorms see the pdf at  for more information
many green roofs are installed to comply with local regulations and government fees often regarding stormwater runoff management in areas with combined sewer-stormwater systems heavy storms can overload the wastewater system and cause it to flood dumping raw sewage into the local waterways green roofs decrease the total amount of runoff and slow the rate of runoff from the roof it has been found that they can retain up to 75% of rainwater gradually releasing it back into the atmosphere via condensation and transpiration while retaining pollutants in their soil often phosphorus and nitrogen are in this category of environmentally harmful substances even though they are stimulating to the growth of plant life and agriculture when these substances are added to a system it can create mass biological activity since they are considered limiting factors of plant growth and by adding more of them to a system it allows for more plant growthelevation 314 a new development in washington dc uses green roofs to filter and store some of its storm water on site avoiding the need for expensive underground sand filters to meet dc department of health storm-water regulations
combating the urban heat island effect is another reason for creating a green roof traditional building materials soak up the sun's radiation and re-emit it as heat making cities at least 4 °c 7.2 °f hotter than surrounding areas on chicago's city hall by contrast which features a green roof roof temperatures on a hot day are typically 1.4–4.4 °c 2.5–7.9 °f cooler than they are on traditionally roofed buildings nearby green roofs are becoming common in chicago as well as in atlanta portland and other united states cities where their use is encouraged by regulations to combat the urban heat-island effect green roofs are a type of low impact development in the case of chicago the city has passed codes offering incentives to builders who put green roofs on their buildings the chicago city hall green roof is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of green roofs in the united states it was planted as an experiment to determine the effects a green roof would have on the microclimate of the roof following this and other studies it has now been estimated that if all the roofs in a major city were greened urban temperatures could be reduced by as much as 7 degrees celsius
green roofs also provide habitats for plants insects and animals that otherwise have limited natural space in cities even in high-rise urban settings as tall as 19 stories it has been found that green roofs can attract beneficial insects birds bees and butterflies rooftop greenery complements wild areas by providing stepping stones for songbirds migratory birds and other wildlife facing shortages of natural habitat
an additional environmental benefit of greens roofs is the ability to sequester carbon carbon is the main component of plant matter and is naturally absorbed by plant tissue the carbon is stored in the plant tissue and the soil substrate through plant litter and root exudates a study on green roofs in michigan and maryland found the above ground biomass and below ground substrate stored on average between 168 g c m−2 and 107 g c m−2  variations occurred among the different species of plant used substrate carbon content averaged 913 g c m−2 and after the subtraction of the original carbon content the total sequestration was 378 g c m−2 the sequestration can be improved by changing plant species increasing substrate depth substrate composition and management practices in a study done in michigan above ground sequestration ranged from 64 g c m−2 to 239 g c m−2 for s acre and s album also by increasing the substrate depth would allow for more area of carbon storage and diversify the types of plants with greater potential of carbon storage the direct carbon sequestration techniques and methods can be measured and accounted for green roofs also indirectly reduce co2 given off by power plants through their ability to insulate buildings buildings in the us account for 38% of the total carbon dioxide emissions a model supported by the us department of energy found a 2 percent reduction in electricity consumption and 9-11% reduction in natural gas when implementing green roofs
a properly designed and installed extensive green-roof system can cost $108–248m2 $10–23ft2 while an intensive green roof costs $355–2368m2 $33–220ft2 however since most of the materials used to build the green roof can be salvaged it is estimated that the cost of replacing a green roof is generally one third of the initial installation costs
with the initial cost of installing a green roof in mind there are many financial benefits that accompany green roofing
the main disadvantage of green roofs is that the initial cost of installing a green roof can be double that of a normal roof the additional mass of the soil substrate and retained water places a large strain on the structural support of a building this makes it unlikely for intensive green roofs to become widely implemented due to a lack of buildings that are able to support such a large amount of added weight as well as the added cost of reinforcing buildings to be able to support such weight some types of green roofs do have more demanding structural standards especially in seismic regions of the world some existing buildings cannot be retrofitted with certain kinds of green roof because of the weight load of the substrate and vegetation exceeds permitted static loading depending on what kind of green roof it is the maintenance costs could be higher but some types of green roof have little or no ongoing cost some kinds of green roofs also place higher demands on the waterproofing system of the structure both because water is retained on the roof and due to the possibility of roots penetrating the waterproof membrane another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include pest insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through open windows
green roofs require significantly more maintenance and maintenance energy compared to a standard roof standard maintenance include removing debris controlling weeds deadhead trimming checking moisture levels and fertilizing the maintenance energy use for green roofs has many variables including climate intensity of rainfall type of building type of vegetation and external coatings the most significant effect comes from scarce rainfall which will increase the maintenance energy due to the watering required during a 10-year roof maintenance cycle a house with a green roof requires more retrofit embodied energy than a house with a white roof the individual components of a green have co2 implications during the manufacturing process have additional implications compared to a conventional roof the embodied energy for green roof components are 23.6 kg 52 lb co2 per square meter of green roof this value is equivalent to 6448 g c m−2 which is significantly greater than 378 g c m-2 
green roofs can be categorized as intensive semi-intensive or extensive depending on the depth of planting medium and the amount of maintenance they need extensive green roofs traditionally support 10-25 pounds of vegetation per square foot 50–120 kgm2 while intensive roofs support 80-150 pounds of vegetation per square foot 390–730 kgm2 traditional roof gardens which require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants or conventional lawns are considered intensive because they are labour-intensive requiring irrigation feeding and other maintenance intensive roofs are more park-like with easy access and may include anything from kitchen herbs to shrubs and small trees extensive green roofs by contrast are designed to be virtually self-sustaining and should require only a minimum of maintenance perhaps a once-yearly weeding or an application of slow-release fertiliser to boost growth extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance they can be established on a very thin layer of soil most use specially formulated composts even a thin layer of rockwool laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of sedum species and mosses some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements to protect the roof a waterproofing membrane is often used which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness ponding water high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots fungi and bacterial organisms
advances in green roof technology have led to the development of new systems that do not fit into the traditional classification of green roof types comprehensive green roofs bring the most advantageous qualities of extensive and intensive green roofs together comprehensive green roofs support plant varieties typically seen in intensive green roofs at the depth and weight of an extensive green roof system
another important distinction is between pitched green roofs and flat green roofs pitched sod roofs a traditional feature of many scandinavian buildings tend to be of a simpler design than flat green roofs this is because the pitch of the roof reduces the risk of water penetrating through the roof structure allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers
modern green roofs which are made of a system of manufactured layers deliberately placed over roofs to support growing medium and vegetation are a relatively new phenomenon however green roofs or sod roofs in northern scandinavia have been around for centuries the modern trend started when green roofs were developed in germany in the 1960s and has since spread to many countries today it is estimated that about 10% of all german roofs have been greened green roofs are also becoming increasingly popular in the united states although they are not as common as in some parts of europe
a number of european countries have very active associations promoting green roofs including germany switzerland the netherlands norway italy austria hungary sweden the uk and greece the city of linz in austria has been paying developers to install green roofs since 1983 and in switzerland it has been a federal law since the late 1990s in the uk their uptake has been slow but a number of cities have developed policies to encourage their use notably london and sheffield
rooftop water purification is also being implemented in green roofs these forms of green roofs are actually treatment ponds built into the rooftops they are built either from a simple substrate as being done in dongtan or with plant-based ponds as being done by waterworks uk grow system and waterzuiverenbe plants used include calamus menyanthes trifoliata mentha aquatica etc
several studies have been carried out in germany since the 1970s berlin is one of the most important centers of green roof research in germany particularly in the last 10 years much more research has begun about ten green roof research centers exist in the us and activities exist in about 40 countries in a recent study on the impacts of green infrastructure in particular green roofs in the greater manchester area researchers found that adding green roofs can help keep temperatures down particularly in urban areas adding green roofs to all buildings can have a dramatic effect on maximum surface temperatures keeping temperatures below the 1961–1990 current form case for all time periods and emissions scenarios roof greening makes the biggest difference…where the building proportion is high and the evaporative fraction is low thus the largest difference was made in the town centers
industrial brownfield sites can be valuable ecosystems supporting rare species of plants animals and invertebrates increasingly in demand for redevelopment these habitats are under threat brown roofs also known as biodiverse roofs can partly mitigate this loss of habitat by covering the flat roofs of new developments with a layer of locally sourced material construction techniques for brown roofs are typically similar to those used to create flat green roofs the main difference being the choice of growing medium usually locally sourced rubble gravel soil etc to meet a specific biodiversity objective in switzerland it is common to use alluvial gravels from the foundations in london a mix of brick rubble and some concrete has been used the original idea was to allow the roofs to self-colonise with plants but they are sometimes seeded to increase their biodiversity potential in the short term such practices are derided by purists the roofs are colonised by spiders and insects many of which are becoming extremely rare in the uk as such sites are developed and provide a feeding site for insectivorous birds laban a centre for contemporary dance in london has a brown roof specifically designed to encourage the nationally rare black redstart a green roof 160m above ground level and claimed to be the highest in the uk and europe and probably in the world to act as nature reserve is on the barclays bank hq in canary wharf designed combining the principles of green and brown roofs it is already home to a range of rare invertebrates
green roofs have been increasing in popularity in australia over the past 10 years some of the early examples include the freshwater place residential tower in melbourne 2002 with its level 10 rooftop half acre garden ch2 building housing the melbourne city council 2006 – australia’s first 6-star green star design commercial office building as certified by the green building council of australia and condor tower 2005 with a 75-square-metre lawn on the 4th floor
in 2010 the largest australian green roof project was announced the victorian desalination project  will have a living tapestry of 98000 australian indigenous plants over a roof area spanning more than 26000 square metres the roof will form part of the desalination plant’s sophisticated roof system designed to blend the building into the landscape and provide acoustic protection corrosion resistance thermal control and reduced maintenance the green roof was designed by aspect studios arm  pecvkvonhartel architecture and will be installed by fytogreen australia 
since 2008 city councils and influential business groups in australia have become active promoting the benefits of green roofs the blueprint to green roof melbourne is one program being run by the committee for melbourne
in june 2014 ecological artist lloyd godman with stuart jones and grant harris in a ground breaking experiment installed tillandsia plants at level 92 91 65 and 56 on eureka tower the air plants are extremely light grow with no soil or watering system and have survived for nearly a year
the city of toronto approved a by-law in may 2009 mandating green roofs on residential and industrial buildings there is criticism from green roofs for healthy cities that the new laws are not stringent enough since they will only apply to residential building that are a minimum of six storeys high by 31 january 2011 industrial buildings were required to render 10% or 2000 m2 of their roofs green toronto city hall's podium roof was renovated to include a 32000 square foot rooftop garden the largest publicly accessible roof in the city the green roof was opened to the public in june 2010

living green roofs have been built and grown at saint michael's sustainable community since 2012 native plants mostly flowers chosen for the environment maximum shade and mass provide a colorful and functional living roof
in egypt soil-less agriculture is used to grow plants on the roofs of buildings no soil is placed directly on the roof itself thus eliminating the need for an insulating layer instead plants are grown on wooden tables vegetables and fruit are the most popular candidates providing a fresh healthy source of food that is free from pesticides
a more advanced method aquaponics being used experimentally in egypt is farming fish next to plants in a closed cycle this allows the plants to benefit from the ammonia excreted by the fish helping the plants to grow better and at the same time eliminating the need for changing the water for the fish because the plants help to keep it clean by absorbing the ammonia the fish also get some nutrients from the roots of the plants
in france an 8000 square metres 86000 sq ft extensive cable-supported green roof has been created on the international school in lyon another huge green roof of roughly 8000 square metres 86000 sq ft has been incorporated into the new museum l'historial de la vendée which opened in june 2006 at les lucs-sur-boulogne
long-held green roof traditions started in the early industrialization period more than 100 years ago exist in germany in the 1970s green roof technology was elevated to the next level serious storm-water issues made cities think about innovative solutions preferably with living plants modern green roof technology with high performance lightweight materials were utilized to grow hardy vegetation even on roofs that can hardly support any additional load in the 1980s modern green roof technology was common knowledge in germany while it was practically unknown in any other country in the world in stuttgart with one of the most innovative department of parks and recreation and with the worlds oldest horticultural universities modern green roof technology was perfected and implemented on a large scale
with the first green roof industry boom in germany there were quality issues recorded the fll formed a committee that is focused on modern green roof technology fll stands for forschungsgesellschaft landschaftsentwicklung landschaftsbau ev fllor in english the german landscape research development and construction society the fll is an independent non-profit organization it was founded in 1975 by eight professional organizations for the improvement of environmental conditions through the advancement and dissemination of plant research and its planned applications the fll green roof working group is only one of 40 committees which have published a long list of guidelines and labor instructions some of these guidelines also available in english including the german fll-guideline for the planning execution and upkeep of green-roof sites the results of the research and synthesis done by fll members are constantly updated and promulgated utilizing the same principles which govern the compilation of din standards and are published as either guiding principles or labor instructions
the current green roof guideline was published in 2011 today most elements of the german fll are part of standards and guidelines around the world fm global astm nrca spri etc
fachvereinigung bauwerksbegrünung fbb was founded in 1990 as the second green roof association after ddv deutscher dachgaertner verband in 1985 fbb was founded as an open forum for manufacturers and planners merchants and operators in 1990 the organization was born from the then-visionary idea of understanding the relationship between nature and constructions not as oppositional but as an opportunity both the green roofing and conventional roofing industries are equally represented the fbb has developed to become an innovative lobbying group with a strong market presence internationally known through its cooperation with other european associations today approximately 100 member companies use the multifaceted services offered by fbb which offers a greater degree of market expertise and competitiveness kompetenz im markt
today about 10000000m2 or 100000000 square feet of new green roofs are being constructed each year according latest studies about ¾ of these are extensive the last ¼ are roof gardens the cities with the most green roofs in germany are berlin and stuttgart surveys about the status of regulation are done by the fbb nearly one third of all german cities have regulations to support green-roof and rain-water technology green-roof research institutions are located in several cities as including hannover berlin geisenheim and neubrandenburg
germany is the country with the most green roofs in the world and it is the country with the most advanced knowledge in modern green roof technology green roofs in germany are part of the 2 –3 years apprentice educations system of landscaping professionals since green roof are common knowledge and common sense it is interesting to take a look at the german wikipedia page for green roofs – there is no need to describe projects case studies or related research the green roof technology was implemented before the internet age
the greek ministry of finance has now installed a green roof on the treasury in constitution square in athens the so-called oikostegi greek – oiko pronounced eeko meaning building-ecological and stegi pronounced staygee meaning roof-abode-shelter was inaugurated in september 2008 studies of the thermodynamics of the roof in september 2008 concluded that the thermal performance of the building was significantly affected by the installation in further studies in august 2009 energy savings of 50% were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation the ten-floor building has a total floor space of 1.4 hectares the oikostegi covers 650 m2 equalling 52% of the roof space and 8% of the total floor space despite this energy savings totalling €5630 per annum were recorded which translates to a 9% saving in air conditioning and a 4% saving in heating bills for the whole building an additional observation and conclusion of the study was that the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months between the first and second study this suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further the study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof such as butterflies honey bees and ladybirds obviously this was not the case before installation finally the study suggested that both the micro-climate and biodiversity of constitution square in athens greece had been improved by the oikostegi

atop the museum of modern art is a modern sculptural garden spanning over 16750 square feet 7500 + 9250 this rooftop is physically inaccessible to the public but has some of the most visible rooftop space in new york ken smith designed moma rooftop as a landscape architect by using 185 plastic rocks 560 artificial boxwoods 300 pounds of clear crushed glass 4 tons of recycled rubber mulch his design was awarded the american society of landscape architecture for design in 2009
in 2001 atop chicago city hall the 38800 square foot roof gardens were completed serving as a pilot project to assess the impact green roofs would have on the heat island effect in urban areas rainwater runoff and the effectiveness of differing types of green roofs and plant species for chicago's climate although the rooftop is not normally accessible to the public it is visually accessible from 33 taller buildings in the area the garden consists of 20000 plants of more than 150 species including shrubs vines and two trees the green roof design team was headed by the chicago area firm conservation design forum in conjunction with noted green architect william mcdonough with an abundance of flowering plants on the rooftop beekeepers harvest approximately 200 pounds of honey each year from hives installed on the rooftop tours of the green roof are by special arrangement only chicago city hall green roof won merit design award of the american society of landscape architecture asla competition in 2002
the 14000 square feet of outdoor space on the seventh floor of zeckendorf towers formerly an undistinguished rooftop filled with potted plants make up the largest residential green roof in new york the roof was transformed in 2010 as part of mayor michael bloomberg's nyc green infrastructure campaign and supposedly serves to capture some of the rain that falls on it rather than letting it run off and contribute to flooding in the adjacent union square subway station
some cost can also be attributed to maintenance extensive green roofs have low maintenance requirements but they are generally not maintenance free german research has quantified the need to remove unwanted seedlings to approximately 6 secondsm2year maintenance of green roofs often includes fertilization to increase flowering and succulent plant cover if aesthetics are not an issue fertilization and maintenance are generally not needed extensive green roofs should only be fertilized with controlled-release fertilizers in order to avoid pollution of the storm water conventional fertilizers should never be used on extensive vegetated roofs german studies have approximated the nutrient requirement of vegetated roofs to 5 gnm2 it is also important to use a substrate that does not contain too many available nutrients the fll guidelines specify maximum-allowable nutrient content of substrates
