a grid-tie inverter is a power inverter that converts direct current dc electricity into alternating current ac with an ability to synchronize to interface with a utility line its applications are converting dc sources such as solar panels or small wind turbines into ac for tying with the grid
residences and businesses that have a grid-tied electrical system are permitted in many countries to sell their energy to the utility grid electricity delivered to the grid can be compensated in several ways net metering is where the entity that owns the renewable energy power source receives compensation from the utility for its net outflow of power so for example if during a given month a power system feeds 500 kilowatt-hours into the grid and uses 100 kilowatt-hours from the grid it would receive compensation for 400 kilowatt-hours in the us net metering policies vary by jurisdiction another policy is a feed-in tariff where the producer is paid for every kilowatt hour delivered to the grid by a special tariff based on a contract with distribution company or other power authority
in the united states grid-interactive power systems are covered by specific provisions in the national electric code which also mandates certain requirements for grid-interactive inverters


inverters take dc power and invert it to ac power so it can be fed into the electric utility company grid the grid tie inverter gti must synchronize its frequency with that of the grid eg 50 or 60 hz using a local oscillator and limit the voltage to no higher than the grid voltage a high-quality modern gti has a fixed unity power factor which means its output voltage and current are perfectly lined up and its phase angle is within 1 degree of the ac power grid the inverter has an on-board computer which senses the current ac grid waveform and output a voltage to correspond with the grid however supplying reactive power to the grid might be necessary to keep the voltage in the local grid inside allowed limitations otherwise in a grid segment with considerable power from renewable sources voltage levels might rise too much at times of high production ie around noon
grid-tie inverters are also designed to quickly disconnect from the grid if the utility grid goes down this is an nec requirement that ensures that in the event of a blackout the grid tie inverter will shut down to prevent the energy it transfers from harming any line workers who are sent to fix the power grid
properly configured a grid tie inverter enables a home owner to use an alternative power generation system like solar or wind power without extensive rewiring and without batteries if the alternative power being produced is insufficient the deficit will be sourced from the electricity grid
technologies available to grid-tie inverters include newer high-frequency transformers conventional low-frequency transformers or they may operate without transformers altogether instead of converting direct current directly to 120 or 240 volts ac high-frequency transformers employ a computerized multi-step process that involves converting the power to high-frequency ac and then back to dc and then to the final ac output voltage transformerless inverters lighter and more efficient than their counterparts with transformers are popular in europe however transformerless inverters have been slow to enter the us market over concerns that transformerless electrical systems could feed into the public utility grid without galvanic isolation between the dc and ac circuits that could allow the passage of dangerous dc faults to be transmitted to the ac side however since 2005 the nfpa's nec allows transformerless or non-galvanically inverters by removing the requirement that all solar electric systems be negative grounded and specifying new safety requirements the vde 0126-1-1 and iec 6210 also have been amended to allow and define the safety mechanisms needed for such systems primarily residual or ground current detection is used to detect possible fault conditions also isolation tests are performed to ensure dc to ac separation
the concept of sinusoidal pulse-width modulation pwm was introduced in an attempt to reduce the harmonic contents at the output voltage level shifted modulation technique gives better result compared with the phase shifting technique level shifting is done to reduce the harmonics at the output voltage most grid-tie inverters on the market include a maximum power point tracker on the input side that enables the inverter to extract a maximum amount of power from its intended power source since mppt algorithms differ for solar panels and wind turbines specially made inverters for each of these power sources are available
inverter manufacturers publish datasheets for the inverters in their product line while the terminology and content will vary by manufacturer datasheets generally include the following information
