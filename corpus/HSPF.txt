hspf heating seasonal performance factor is a term used in the heating and cooling industry hspf is specifically used to measure the efficiency of air source heat pumps
the efficiency of air conditioners are often rated by the hspf as defined by the air conditioning heating and refrigeration institute in its standard 210240 performance rating of unitary air-conditioning and air-source heat pump equipment
the higher the hspf rating of a unit the more energy efficient it is hspf is a ratio of btu heat output over the heating season to watt-hours of electricity used it has units of btuwatt-hr
depending on the system an hspf ≥ 8 can be considered high efficiency and worthy of a us energy tax credit
the hspf is related to the non-dimensional coefficient of performance for a heat pump which measures the ratio of heat energy delivered to electrical energy supplied independently of the units used to measure energy the hspf can be converted to a seasonally-averaged cop by converting both the btu heat output and the electrical input to a common energy unit eg joules since 1 btu = 1055.056 j and 1 watt-hour = 3600 j the seasonally-averaged cop is given by
avg cop = heat transferred  electrical energy supplied = hspf  1055.056 jbtu  3600 jwatt-hour = 0.29307111 hspf
thus a system which delivers an hspf of 7.7 will transfer 2.25 times as much heat as electricity consumed over a season in europe the term seasonal performance factor spf is used to mean the same as the average cop over the heating season thus a system which transfers 2.25 times as much heat as the electricity consumed is said to have an spf of 2.25 a well designed ground source heat pump installation should achieve an spf of 3.5 or over 5 if linked to a solar-assisted thermal bank
example for a heat pump delivering 120000000 btu during the season when consuming 15000 kwh the hspf can be calculated as
