the heat index hi or humiture or humidex not to be confused with the canadian humidex is an index that combines air temperature and relative humidity in an attempt to determine the human-perceived equivalent temperature—how hot it would feel if the humidity were some other value the result is also known as the felt air temperature or apparent temperature for example when the temperature is 32 °c 90 °f with very high humidity the heat index can be about 41 °c 106 °f
the human body normally cools itself by perspiration or sweating heat is removed from the body by evaporation of that sweat however high relative humidity reduces the evaporation rate this results in a lower rate of heat removal from the body hence the sensation of being overheated this effect is subjective its measurement has been based on subjective descriptions of how hot subjects feel for a given temperature and humidity this results in a heat index that relates one combination of temperature and humidity to another


the heat index was developed in 1978 by george winterling as the humiture and was adopted by the usa's national weather service a year later it is derived from work carried out by robert g steadman like the wind chill index the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height clothing amount of physical activity thickness of blood sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure and the wind speed significant deviations from these will result in heat index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature
in canada the similar humidex is used in place of the heat index while both the humidex and the heat index are calculated using dew point the humidex uses a dew point of 45 °f 7 °c as a base whereas the heat index uses a dew point base of 57 °f 14 °c further the heat index uses heat balance equations which account for many variables other than vapor pressure which is used exclusively in the humidex calculation a joint committeewho? formed by the united states and canada to resolve differences has since been disbandedcitation needed
the heat index is defined so as to equal the actual air temperature when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to a baseline value of 1.6 kpa at standard atmospheric pressure 101.325 kpa this baseline corresponds to a dew point of 14 °c 57 °f and a mixing ratio of 0.01 10 g of water vapor per kilogram of dry air this corresponds to an air temperature of 25 °c 77 °f and relative humidity of 50% in the sea-level psychrometric chart
a given value of relative humidity causes larger increases in the heat index at higher temperatures for example at approximately 27 °c 81 °f the heat index will agree with the actual temperature if the relative humidity is 45% but at 43 °c 109 °f any relative-humidity reading above 18% will make the heat index higher than 43 °c
it has been suggested that the equation described is valid only if the temperature is 27 °c 80 °f or more and the relative humidity is 40% or more however a recent analysis by iweathernet found the assumption to be erroneous given that the heat indexrelative humidity relationship and the corresponding equilibrium temperature the point at which the air temperature and the heat index are equal are nonlinear the heat index and humidex figures are based on temperature measurements taken in the shade and not the sun so extra care must be taken while in the sun the heat index also does not factor in the effects of wind which lowers the apparent temperature unless the air is above body temperature
sometimes the heat index and the wind chill are denoted collectively by the single term apparent temperature relative outdoor temperature or feels like
outdoors in open conditions as the relative humidity increases first haze and ultimately a thicker cloud cover develops reducing the amount of direct sunlight reaching the surface thus there is an inverse relationship between maximum potential temperature and maximum potential relative humidity because of this factor it was once believed that the highest heat index reading actually attainable anywhere on earth is approximately 71 °c 160 °f however in dhahran saudi arabia on july 8 2003 the dew point was 35 °c 95 °f while the temperature was 42 °c 108 °f resulting in a heat index of 78 °c 172 °f
this table is from the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration
for example if the air temperature is 96 °f  36 °c and the relative humidity is 65% the heat index is 121 °f  49 °c
exposure to full sunshine can increase heat index values by up to 8 °c 14 °f
the formula below approximates the heat index in degrees fahrenheit to within ±1.3 °f it is the result of a multivariate fit temperature equal to or greater than 80 °f and relative humidity equal to or greater than 40% to a model of the human body this equation reproduces the above noaa national weather service table except the values at 90 °f & 45%70% relative humidity vary unrounded by less than -1+1 respectively
where
an alternative set of constants for this equation that is within 3 degrees of the nws master table for all humidities from 0 to 80% and all temperatures between 70 and 115 °f and all heat indexes < 150 °f is
a further alternate is this

where
for example using this last formula with temperature 90 °f 32 °c and relative humidity rh of 85% the result would be heat index for 90 °f rh 85% = 114.9
