a heat sink also commonly spelled heatsink is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device into a coolant fluid in motion then-transferred heat leaves the device with the fluid in motion therefore allowing the regulation of the device temperature at physically feasible levels in computers heat sinks are used to cool central processing units or graphics processors heat sinks are used with high-power semiconductor devices such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and light emitting diodes leds where the heat dissipation ability of the basic device is insufficient to moderate its temperature
a heat sink is designed to maximize its surface area in contact with the cooling medium surrounding it such as the air air velocity choice of material protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device the heat sink is usually made out of copper and aluminum copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers first and foremost copper is an excellent conductor of heat this means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly


a heat sink transfers thermal energy from a higher temperature device to a lower temperature fluid medium the fluid medium is frequently air but can also be water refrigerants or oil if the fluid medium is water the heat sink is frequently called a cold plate in thermodynamics a heat sink is a heat reservoir that can absorb an arbitrary amount of heat without significantly changing temperature practical heat sinks for electronic devices must have a temperature higher than the surroundings to transfer heat by convection radiation and conduction the power supplies of electronics are not 100% efficient so extra heat is produced that may be detrimental to the function of the device as such a heat sink is included in the design to disperse heat to improve efficient energy use
to understand the principle of a heat sink consider fourier's law of heat conduction fourier's law of heat conduction simplified to a one-dimensional form in the x-direction shows that when there is a temperature gradient in a body heat will be transferred from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region the rate at which heat is transferred by conduction  is proportional to the product of the temperature gradient and the cross-sectional area through which heat is transferred
consider a heat sink in a duct where air flows through the duct as shown in figure 2 it is assumed that the heat sink base is higher in temperature than the air applying the conservation of energy for steady-state conditions and newton’s law of cooling to the temperature nodes shown in figure 2 gives the following set of equations
where
using the mean air temperature is an assumption that is valid for relatively short heat sinks when compact heat exchangers are calculated the logarithmic mean air temperature is used is the air mass flow rate in kgs
the above equations show that
natural convection requires free flow of air over the heat sink if fins are not aligned vertically or if fins are too close together to allow sufficient air flow between them the efficiency of the heat sink will decline
for semiconductor devices used in a variety of consumer and industrial electronics the idea of thermal resistance simplifies the selection of heat sinks the heat flow between the semiconductor die and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow there is a resistance from the die to the device case from the case to the heat sink and from the heat sink to the ambient air the sum of these resistances is the total thermal resistance from the die to the ambient air thermal resistance is defined as temperature rise per unit of power analogous to electrical resistance and is expressed in units of degrees celsius per watt °cw if the device dissipation in watts is known and the total thermal resistance is calculated the temperature rise of the die over the ambient air can be calculated
the idea of thermal resistance of a semiconductor heat sink is an approximation it does not take into account non-uniform distribution of heat over a device or heat sink it only models a system in thermal equilibrium and does not take into account the change in temperatures with time nor does it reflect the non-linearity of radiation and convection with respect to temperature rise however manufacturers tabulate typical values of thermal resistance for heat sinks and semiconductor devices which allows selection of commercially manufactured heat sinks to be simplified
commercial extruded aluminium heat sinks have a thermal resistance heat sink to ambient air ranging from 0.4 °cw for a large sink meant for to3 devices up to as high as 85 °cw for a clip-on heat sink for a to92 small plastic case the popular 2n3055 power transistor in a to3 case has an internal thermal resistance from junction to case of 1.52 °cw the contact between the device case and heat sink may have a thermal resistance of between 0.5 up to 1.7 °cw depending on the case size and use of grease or insulating mica washer
the most common heat sink materials are aluminium alloys aluminium alloy 1050a has one of the higher thermal conductivity values at 229 wm•k  but is mechanically soft aluminium alloys 6061 and 6063 are commonly used with thermal conductivity values of 166 and 201 wm•k respectively the values depend on the temper of the alloy
copper has excellent heat sink properties in terms of its thermal conductivity corrosion resistance biofouling resistance and antimicrobial resistance see main article copper in heat exchangers copper has around twice the thermal conductivity of aluminium and faster more efficient heat absorption its main applications are in industrial facilities power plants solar thermal water systems hvac systems gas water heaters forced air heating and cooling systems geothermal heating and cooling and electronic systems
copper is three times as dense and more expensive than aluminium copper heat sinks are machined and skived another method of manufacture is to solder the fins into the heat sink base aluminium heat sinks can be extruded but the less ductile copper cannot
diamond is another heat sink material and its thermal conductivity of 2000 wm•k exceeds copper five-foldunreliable source? in contrast to metals where heat is conducted by delocalized electrons lattice vibrations are responsible for diamond's very high thermal conductivity for thermal management applications the outstanding thermal conductivity and diffusivity of diamond is an essential nowadays synthetic diamond is used as submounts for high-power integrated circuits and laser diodes
composite materials can be used examples are a copper-tungsten pseudoalloy alsic silicon carbide in aluminium matrix dymalloy diamond in copper-silver alloy matrix and e-material beryllium oxide in beryllium matrix such materials are often used as substrates for chips as their thermal expansion coefficient can be matched to ceramics and semiconductors
fin efficiency is one of the parameters which makes a higher thermal conductivity material important a fin of a heat sink may be considered to be a flat plate with heat flowing in one end and being dissipated into the surrounding fluid as it travels to the other as heat flows through the fin the combination of the thermal resistance of the heat sink impeding the flow and the heat lost due to convection the temperature of the fin and therefore the heat transfer to the fluid will decrease from the base to the end of the fin fin efficiency is defined as the actual heat transferred by the fin divided by the heat transfer were the fin to be isothermal hypothetically the fin having infinite thermal conductivity equations 6 and 7 are applicable for straight fins
where
fin efficiency is increased by decreasing the fin aspect ratio making them thicker or shorter or by using more conductive material copper instead of aluminium for example
another parameter that concerns the thermal conductivity of the heat sink material is spreading resistance spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy is transferred from a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity in a heat sink this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the heat sink base the spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and the edges of the heat sink this means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of the heat sink this nonuniformity increases the heat sink's effective thermal resistance
to decrease the spreading resistance in the base of a heat sink
the shape of fins must be optimized to maximize heat transfer density and to minimize the pressure drop in the coolant fluid across the heat sink where the space and the materials used for the finned surfaces are constraints many shapes exist in the literature ranging from elliptical and cylindrical cylinders conical shapes to more sharpened surfaces such as rhombus square sections
a pin fin heat sink is a heat sink that has pins that extend from its base the pins can be cylindrical elliptical or square a pin is by far one of the more common heat sink types available on the marketcitation needed a second type of heat sink fin arrangement is the straight fin these run the entire length of the heat sink a variation on the straight fin heat sink is a cross cut heat sink a straight fin heat sink is cut at regular intervals
in general the more surface area a heat sink has the better it works however this is not always true the concept of a pin fin heat sink is to try to pack as much surface area into a given volume as possible as well it works well in any orientation kordyban has compared the performance of a pin fin and a straight fin heat sink of similar dimensions although the pin fin has 194 cm2 surface area while the straight fin has 58 cm2 the temperature difference between the heat sink base and the ambient air for the pin fin is 50 °c for the straight fin it was 44 °c or 6 °c better than the pin fin pin fin heat sink performance is significantly better than straight fins when used in their intended application where the fluid flows axially along the pins see figure 17 rather than only tangentially across the pins
another configuration is the flared fin heat sink its fins are not parallel to each other as shown in figure 5 flaring the fins decreases flow resistance and makes more air go through the heat sink fin channel otherwise more air would bypass the fins slanting them keeps the overall dimensions the same but offers longer fins forghan et al have published data on tests conducted on pin fin straight fin and flared fin heat sinks they found that for low approach air velocity typically around 1 ms the thermal performance is at least 20% better than straight fin heat sinks lasance and eggink also found that for the bypass configurations that they tested the flared heat sink performed better than the other heat sinks tested
in the recent years utilization of high-conductivity materials inserts have been proposed for electronic cooling and for enhancing the heat removal from small chips to a heat sink because the space occupied by high conductivity materials together with the cost are the two elements of major concern therefore seeking for more efficient designs of high conductivity pathways embedded into a heat generating body constitutes a formidable challenge
cavities inverted fins embedded in a heat source are the regions formed between adjacent fins that stand for the essential promoters of nucleate boiling or condensation these cavities are usually utilized to extract heat from a variety of heat generating bodies to a heat sink
placing a conductive thick plate as a heat transfer interface between a heat source and a cold flowing fluid or any other heat sink may improve the cooling performance in such arrangement the heat source is cooled under the thick plate instead of being cooled in direct contact with the cooling fluid it is shown that the thick plate can significantly improve the heat transfer between the heat source and the cooling fluid by way of conducting the heat current in an optimal manner the two most attractive advantages of this method are that no additional pumping power and no extra heat transfer surface area that is quite different from fins extended surfaces
the heat transfer from the heat sink occurs by convection of the surrounding air conduction through the air and radiation
heat transfer by radiation is a function of both the heat sink temperature and the temperature of the surroundings that the heat sink is optically coupled with when both of these temperatures are on the order of 0 °c to 100 °c the contribution of radiation compared to convection is generally small and this factor is often neglected in this case finned heat sinks operating in either natural-convection or forced-flow will not be affected significantly by surface emissivity
in situations where convection is low such as a flat non-finned panel with low airflow radiative cooling can be a significant factor here the surface properties may be an important design factor matte-black surfaces will radiate much more efficiently than shiny bare metalunreliable source? a shiny metal surface has low emissivity the emissivity of a material is tremendously frequency dependent and is related to absorptivity of which shiny metal surfaces have very little for most materials the emissivity in the visible spectrum is similar to the emissivity in the infrared spectrumcitation needed however there are exceptions notably certain metal oxides that are used as selective surfaces
in a vacuum or in outer space there is no convective heat transfer thus in these environments radiation is the only factor governing heat flow between the heat sink and the environment for a satellite in space a 100 °c 373 kelvin surface facing the sun will absorb a lot of radiant heat because the sun's surface temperature is nearly 6000 kelvin whereas the same surface facing deep-space will radiate a lot of heat since deep-space has an effective temperature of only a few kelvin
heat dissipation is an unavoidable by-product of electronic devices and circuits in general the temperature of the device or component will depend on the thermal resistance from the component to the environment and the heat dissipated by the component to ensure that the component temperature does not overheat a thermal engineer seeks to find an efficient heat transfer path from the device to the environment the heat transfer path may be from the component to a printed circuit board pcb to a heat sink to air flow provided by a fan but in all instances eventually to the environment
two additional design factors also influence the thermalmechanical performance of the thermal design
as power dissipation of components increases and component package size decreases thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat devices that run cooler last longer a heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal as well as its mechanical requirements concerning the latter the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration the heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board or else a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy wire-form z clips flat spring clips standoff spacers and push pins with ends that expand after installing
thermally conductive tape is one of the most cost-effective heat sink attachment materials it is suitable for low-mass heat sinks and for components with low power dissipation it consists of a thermally conductive carrier material with a pressure-sensitive adhesive on each side
this tape is applied to the base of the heat sink which is then attached to the component following are factors that influence the performance of thermal tape
epoxy is more expensive than tape but provides a greater mechanical bond between the heat sink and component as well as improved thermal conductivity the epoxy chosen must be formulated for this purpose most epoxies are two-part liquid formulations that must be thoroughly mixed before being applied to the heat sink and before the heat sink is placed on the component the epoxy is then cured for a specified time which can vary from 2 hours to 48 hours faster cure time can be achieved at higher temperatures the surfaces to which the epoxy is applied must be clean and free of any residue
the epoxy bond between the heat sink and component is semi-permanentpermanent this makes re-work very difficult and at times impossible the most typical damage caused by rework is the separation of the component die heat spreader from its package
more expensive than tape and epoxy wire form z-clips attach heat sinks mechanically to use the z-clips the printed circuit board must have anchors anchors can be either soldered onto the board or pushed through either type requires holes to be designed into the board the use of rohs solder must be allowed for because such solder is mechanically weaker than traditional pbsn solder
to assemble with a z-clip attach one side of it to one of the anchors deflect the spring until the other side of the clip can be placed in the other anchor the deflection develops a spring load on the component which maintains very good contact in addition to the mechanical attachment that the z-clip provides it also permits using higher-performance thermal interface materials such as phase change types
available for processors and ball grid array bga components clips allow the attachment of a bga heat sink directly to the component the clips make use of the gap created by the ball grid array bga between the component underside and pcb top surface the clips therefore require no holes in the pcb they also allow for easy rework of components examples of commercially available clips are the maxigriptm and supergriptm range from advanced thermal solutions ats and the talon cliptm from malico the three aforementioned clipping methods use plastic frames for the clips but the ats designs uses metal spring clips to provide the compression force the malico design uses the plastic arm to provide a mechanical load on the component depending on the product requirement the clipping methods will have to meet shock and vibration standards such as telecordia gr-63-core etsi 300 019 and mil-std-810
for larger heat sinks and higher preloads push pins with compression springs are very effective the push pins typically made of brass or plastic have a flexible barb at the end that engages with a hole in the pcb once installed the barb retains the pin the compression spring holds the assembly together and maintains contact between the heat sink and component care is needed in selection of push pin size too great an insertion force can result in the die cracking and consequent component failure
for very large heat sinks there is no substitute for the threaded standoff and compression spring attachment method a threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads one end is secured with a screw through a hole in the pcb the other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring completing the assembly a typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design another disadvantage is the need for holes in the pcb
thermal contact resistance occurs due to the voids created by surface roughness effects defects and misalignment of the interface the voids present in the interface are filled with air heat transfer is therefore due to conduction across the actual contact area and to conduction or natural convection and radiation across the gaps if the contact area is small as it is for rough surfaces the major contribution to the resistance is made by the gaps to decrease the thermal contact resistance the surface roughness can be decreased while the interface pressure is increased however these improving methods are not always practical or possible for electronic equipment thermal interface materials tim are a common way to overcome these limitations
properly applied thermal interface materials displace the air that is present in the gaps between the two objects with a material that has a much-higher thermal conductivity air has a thermal conductivity of 0.022 wm•k while tims have conductivities of 0.3 wm•k and higher
when selecting a tim care must be taken with the values supplied by the manufacturer most manufacturers give a value for the thermal conductivity of a material however the thermal conductivity does not take into account the interface resistances therefore if a tim has a high thermal conductivity it does not necessarily mean that the interface resistance will be low
selection of a tim is based on three parameters the interface gap which the tim must fill the contact pressure and the electrical resistivity of the tim the contact pressure is the pressure applied to the interface between the two materials the selection does not include the cost of the material electrical resistivity may be important depending upon electrical design details
light-emitting diode led performance and lifetime are strong functions of their temperature effective cooling is therefore essential a case study of a led based downlighter shows an example of the calculations done in order to calculate the required heat sink necessary for the effective cooling of lighting system the article also shows that in order to get confidence in the results multiple independent solutions are required that give similar results specifically results of the experimental numerical and theoretical methods should all be within 10% of each other to give high confidence in the results
temporary heat sinks are sometimes used while soldering circuit boards preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics in the simplest case this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip hemostat or similar clamp modern semiconductor devices which are designed to be assembled by reflow soldering can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage on the other hand electrical components such as magnetic reed switches can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons so this practice is still very much in use
in general a heat sink performance is a function of material thermal conductivity dimensions fin type heat transfer coefficient air flow rate and duct size to determine the thermal performance of a heat sink a theoretical model can be made alternatively the thermal performance can be measured experimentally due to the complex nature of the highly 3d flow in present applications numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics cfd can also be used this section will discuss the aforementioned methods for the determination of the heat sink thermal performance
one of the methods to determine the performance of a heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory one such method has been published by jeggels et al though this work is limited to ducted flow ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink this makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink when the air flow is not ducted a certain percentage of air flow will bypass the heat sink flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity
the heat sink thermal resistance model consists of two resistances namely the resistance in the heat sink base  and the resistance in the fins  the heat sink base thermal resistance  can be written as follows if the source is a uniformly applied the heat sink base if it is not then the base resistance is primarily spreading resistance
where is the heat sink base thickness is the heat sink material thermal conductivity and is the area of the heat sink base
the thermal resistance from the base of the fins to the air  can be calculated by the following formulas
the flow rate can be determined by the intersection of the heat sink system curve and the fan curve the heat sink system curve can be calculated by the flow resistance of the channels and inlet and outlet losses as done in standard fluid mechanics text books such as potter et al and white
once the heat sink base and fin resistances are known then the heat sink thermal resistance can be calculated as 14
using the equations 5 to 13 and the dimensional data in the thermal resistance for the fins was calculated for various air flow rates the data for the thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficient are shown in figure 14 it shows that for an increasing air flow rate the thermal resistance of the heat sink increases
experimental tests are one of the more popular ways to determine the heat sink thermal performance in order to determine the heat sink thermal resistance the flow rate input power inlet air temperature and heat sink base temperature need to be known figure 2 shows a test setup for a ducted flow heat sink application vendor-supplied data is commonly provided for ducted test results however the results are optimistic and can give misleading data when heat sinks are used in an unducted application more details on heat sink testing methods and common oversights can be found in azar et al
in industry thermal analyses are often ignored in the design process or performed too late — when design changes are limited and become too costly of the three methods mentioned in this article theoretical and numerical methods can be used to determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made a theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics cfd provide a qualitative and sometimes even quantitative prediction of fluid flows what this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation like the images in figures 16 and 17 and the cfd animations in figure 18 and 19 but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters
cfd can give an insight into flow patterns that are difficult expensive or impossible to study using experimental methods experiments can give a quantitative description of flow phenomena using measurements for one quantity at a time at a limited number of points and time instances if a full-scale model is not available or not practical scale models or dummy models can be used the experiments can have a limited range of problems and operating conditions simulations can give a prediction of flow phenomena using cfd software for all desired quantities with high resolution in space and time and virtually any problem and realistic operating conditions however if critical the results may need to be validated
