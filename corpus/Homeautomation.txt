home automation is the use and control of home appliances remotely or automatically early home automation began with labour-saving machines like washing machines some home automation appliances are stand alone and do not communicate such as a programmable light switch while others are part of the internet of things and are networked for remote control and data transfer hardware devices can include sensors like cameras and thermometers controllers actuators to do things and communication systems remote control can range from a simple remote control to a smartphone with bluetooth to a computer on the other side of the world connected by internet home automation systems are available which consist of a suite of products designed to work together these typically connected through wi-fi or power line communication to a hub which is then accessed with a software application popular applications include thermostats security systems blinds lighting and door locks popular suites of products include x10 z-wave and zigbee all of which are incompatible with each other home automation is the domestic application of building automation


in 1885 when the swiss-born albert butz invented the damper-flapper a thermostat for coal furnaces to automatically regulate heating systems the following year he founded the butz thermo-electric regulator company in 1888 after a falling out with his investors butz left the company and transferred the patents to the legal firm paul sanford and merwin who renamed the company the consolidated temperature controlling company the company was renamed to the electric heat regulator company in 1893 in 1906 mark honeywell founded the honeywell heating specialty company in wabash indiana to manufacture and market his invention the mercury seal generator as honeywell’s company grew thanks in part to the acquisition of jewell manufacturing company in 1922 to better automate his heating system it began to clash with the renamed minneapolis heat regulator company this led to the merging of the two companies into the publicly held minneapolis-honeywell regulator company in 1927
in 1898 nikola tesla patented a remote control for vessels and vehicles while many home appliances have existed for centuries the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances became viable in the 1900s with the introduction of electric power distribution in the early 1900s electric and gas appliances included washing machines water heaters refrigerators and sewing machines in the post–world war ii economic expansion the domestic use of dishwashers and clothes dryers were part of a shift for convenience and increasing discretionary income
the first microprocessors emerged in the early 1970s and were used in embedded systems like calculators and microcomputers the honeywell 316 kitchen computer of 1969 was offered by neiman marcus for $10000 $63730 in 2013 dollars weighed over 100 pounds over 45 kg and was advertised as useful for storing recipes reading or entering these recipes required the user to complete a two-week course just to learn how to program the device using only toggle-switch input and binary light output it had a built in cutting board and had a few recipes built in no evidence has been found that any honeywell kitchen computers were ever sold
in 1975 x10 the first general purpose home automation network technology was developed it is a communication protocol for electronic devices it primarily uses electric power transmission wiring for signalling and control where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts of digital data and remains the most widely available although higher bandwidth alternatives exist x10 remains popular in the home environment with millions of units in use worldwide and inexpensive availability of new components by 1978 x10 products included a 16 channel command console a lamp module and an appliance module soon after came the wall switch module and the first x10 timer
by 2012 in the united states according to abi research 1.5 million home automation systems were installed
the internet of things iot is the network of physical objects—devices vehicles buildings and other items—embedded with electronics software sensors and network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data the iot allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems and resulting in improved efficiency accuracy and economic benefit when iot is augmented with sensors and actuators the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids smart homes intelligent transportation and smart cities each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing internet infrastructure expertswhich? estimate that the iot will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020citation needed
there are a wide variety of technology platforms or protocols on which a smart home can be built each one is essentially its own language each language speaks to the various connected devices and instructs them to perform a function
the automation protocol transport has involved direct wire connectivity powerline plc powerline plc and wireless hybrid and wireless
