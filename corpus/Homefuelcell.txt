a home fuel cell is a residential-scaled energy system based on fuel cell technology it's one of the available technologies for micro combined heat and power microchp or microgeneration a home fuel cell increases efficiency by simultaneously generating power and heat from one unit to be used on-site within a home thus eliminating heat loss and transmission loss
combined heat and power chp fuel cells have demonstrated superior efficiency for years in industrial plants universities hotels and hospitals residential and small-scale commercial fuel cells are now becoming available to fulfill both electricity and heat demand from one system fuel cell technology in a compact system converts natural gas propane and eventually biofuels—into both electricity and heat producing carbon dioxide and small amounts of nox as exhaust in the future new developments in fuel cell technologies will likely allow these power systems to run off of biomass instead of natural gas directly converting a home fuel cell into a renewable energy technology


most home fuel cells fit either inside a mechanical room or outside a home or business and can be discreetly sited to fit within a building's design the system operates like a furnace water heater and electricity provider—all in one compact unit some of the newer home fuel cells can generate anywhere between 1–5 kw—optimal for larger homes 370 square metres 4000 sq ft or more especially if pools spas and radiant floor heating are in plans other uses include sourcing of back-up power for essential loads like refrigeratorfreezers electronicscomputers and wine cellars
deploying the system’s heat energy efficiently to a home or business' hot water applications displaces the electricity or gas otherwise burned to create that heat which further reduces overall energy bills retail outlets like fast food chains coffee bars and health clubs gain operational savings from hot water heating
since it is in general not possible for a fuel cell to produce at all times exactly the needed amount of both electricity and heat home fuel cells are typically not standalone installations instead they may rely on the grid when the electricity production is above or below what is needed additionally a home fuel cell may be combined with a traditional furnace that produces only heat for example the german company viessmann produces a home fuel cell with an electric power of 0.75 kw and a thermal power of 1 kw integrated with a traditional 19 kw heat producing furnace using the grid for electricity need below and above the fuel cell production
because the home fuel cell generates electricity and heat that are both used on site its efficiency is per definition 100% this is in contrast to traditional or fuel cell non-domestic electricity production with both a transmission loss and useless heat requiring extra energy consumption for the domestic heating as noted above however the home fuel cell can in general not at all times generate exactly the needed amount of both heat and electricity and is therefore typically not a standalone installation but rather combined with a traditional furnace and connected to the grid for electricity need above or below that produced by the fuel cell as such the overall efficiency is below 100% the optimum efficiency of home fuels cell has caused some countries such as germany to economically support their installation as part of a policy reacting to climate change
home fuel cells are designed and built to fit in either an interior mechanical room or outside—running quietly in the background 247 connected to the utility grid through the home’s main service panel and using net metering the home fuel cells easily integrate with existing electrical and hydronic systems and are compliant with utility interconnection requirements in the event of grid interruption the system automatically switches to operate in a grid-independent mode to provide continuous backup power for dedicated circuits in the home while the grid is down it can also be modified to run off-the-grid if desired
twenty companies have installed bloom energy fuel cells in their buildings including google ebay and fedex the ebay ceo said to 60 minutes that they have saved $100000 in electricity bills in the 9 months they have been installed
oregon-based clearedge power has installations of its 5 kw system at the home of jackie autry bay area wealth manager bruce raabe and vc investor gary dillabough
delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012
most home fuel cells are comparable to residential solar energy photovoltaic systems on a dollar per watt-installed basiscitation needed some natural gas driven home fuel cells can generate eight times more energy per year than the same size solar installation even in the best solar locationscitation needed for example a 5 kw home fuel cell produces about 80 mwh of annual combined electricity and heat compared to approximately 10mwh generated by a 5 kw solar system however these systems are not directly comparable because solar power is a renewable resource with basically no operating cost while natural gas is neither
operating costs for home fuel cells can be as low as 6.0¢ per kwh based on $1.20 per therm for natural gas assuming full electrical and heat load utilizationwhere?citation needed
in the usa home fuel cells are eligible for substantial incentives and rebates at both the state and federal levels as a part of renewable energy policy for example the california self generation incentive program sgip rebate $2500 per kw and federal tax credits $1000 per kw residential and $3000 per kw commercial will significantly reduce the net capital cost to the customer for businesses additional cash advantages can be realized from bonus and accelerated depreciation of fuel cells
in addition home fuel cells receive net metering credit in many service areas for any excess electricity generated but not used by putting it back on the utility gridcitation needed
the database of state incentives for renewables & efficiency dsire provides comprehensive information on state local utility and federal incentives that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency
in california in particular utilities charge higher per kwh rates as energy consumption rises above established baselines – with the top tier set at the highest rates to discourage consumption at those levels home fuel cells reduce customer exposure to the top tier rates saving homeowners as much as 45% in reduced annual energy costs
home fuel cells is a new market and represents a fundamental shift in the sourcing of energy an individual home fuel cell system installed in a us home becomes a part of the bigger picture of us energy independence an ultimate benefit of home fuel cells will be to eventually create networks of micro-chp systems distributed throughout communities and business parks this self-generation of energy in a distributed generation approach that will secure and increase us power generating capacity enabling unused electricity to be sent back to the grids without having to add new power plants and transmission lines putting a home fuel cell system into homes has the potential to get people off-the-grid play a significant role in energy efficiency and reduce us dependence on foreign energy importscitation needed
