hybrid power are combinations between different technologies to produce power
in power engineering the term 'hybrid' describes a combined power and energy storage system it does not mean a method such as the popular use of hybrid to mean a hybrid electric vehicle like the toyota prius
examples of power producers used in hybrid power are photovoltaics wind turbines and various types of generators - eg diesel gen-sets
hybrid power plants can be balanced by diesel gensets or storage systems
hybrid systems as the name implies combine two or more modes of electricity generation together usually using renewable technologies such as solar photovoltaic pv and wind turbines hybrid systems provide a high level of energy security through the mix of generation methods and often will incorporate a storage system battery fuel cell or small fossil fueled generator to ensure maximum supply reliability and security
