canada is the world's second largest producer of hydroelectricity after china which is more than double canada's level  and one of few countries to generate the majority of its electricity from hydroelectricity 59% in 2006 in 2011 canada consumed the equivalent of 85.2 megatonnes of oil of hydroelectricity 10.8% of all the hydroelectricity generated in the world some provinces and territories such as british columbia manitoba newfoundland and labrador quebec and yukon produce over 90% of their electricity in this manner all of the dams with large reservoirs were completed before 1990 since then most development has been run-of-the-river both large and small natural resources canada calculates the current installed small hydro capacity is 3400 mw with an estimated potential of 15000 mw


90% of bc hydro's generation is produced by hydroelectric means natural gas and biomass thermal power round out the generation portfolio
over 80% of bc hydro's installed in generating capacity is at hydroelectric installations in the peace and columbia river basins the gm shrum and peace canyon generating stations on the peace river produced 29% of bc hydro's electricity requirements in the columbia river basin mica and revelstoke hydroelectric plants together contributed 25% while kootenay canal and seven mile generating stations together supplied 10%
the remaining 25 hydroelectric generating stations supplied 14% of electricity production bc hydro also operates thermal power plants the burrard thermal generating station contributes 7.5% and the remaining 14.5% of the electricity requirement was supplied by purchases and other transactions
bc hydro's last dam was completed in 1984 since then run-of-the-river projects with private partners have been built power production without reservoirs varies dramatically though the year so older dams with large reservoirs retain water and average out capacity as of 2012 there were approximately 40 small hydro sites generating 750 mw  by 2014 various companies have built a total of 100 run of the river projects under 50mw in 2014 they produced 18000 gwh from 4500 mw of capacity

as of march 31 2013 manitoba hydro serves a peak manitoba electrical load of more than 4500 megawatts electrical supply to manitoba customers was 21.5 terawatt-hours in fiscal 2013 with total revenue due to electricity of $1.733 billion cad extraprovincial sales were at 9.1 terawatthours with normal water flows the company also delivered 2.05 billion cubic metres of natural gas in 2013 which contributed $573 million cad to revenues

hydro-québec's extensive network of 61 hydroelectric dams have a combined capacity of 36068 megawatts accounting for nearly half of the canadian total hydropower accounts for 95.73% of the supply sold by the quebec state-owned utility five of hydro-québec's hydroelectric facilities are rated above 2000 mw — the manic-5 la grande-4 la grande-3 la grande-2-a and robert-bourassa stations — while 7 others have a capacity of over 1000 megawatts
