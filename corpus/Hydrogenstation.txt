since the turn of the millennium filling stations offering hydrogen have been opening worldwide however this does not begin to replace the existing extensive gasoline fuel station infrastructure which in the us alone numbered 168000 retail outlets  in 2004 with revenues for 2014 of us$536 billion according to joseph romm in 2004 replacing these would cost a half trillion us dollars the cost of the necessary european-wide hydrogen fuelling infrastructure could be five times lower than the cost of the charging network required for battery and plug-in hybrid vehicles
hydrogen home stations come in different types
