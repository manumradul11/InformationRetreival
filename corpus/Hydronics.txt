hydronics is the use of water or another liquid heat transfer medium such as glycol as the heat-transfer medium in heating and cooling systems some of the oldest and most common examples are steam and hot-water radiators historically in large-scale commercial buildings such as high-rise and campus facilities a hydronic system may include both a chilled and a heated water loop to provide for both heating and air conditioning chillers and cooling towers are used separately or together as means to provide water cooling while boilers heat water a recent innovation is the chiller boiler system which provides an efficient form of hvac for homes and smaller commercial spaces


many larger cities have a district heating system that provides through underground piping publicly available steam and chilled water a building in the service district may be connected to these on payment of a service fee
hydronic systems are of two basic types
hydronic systems are classified in five ways
hydronic systems may be divided into several general piping arrangement categories
in the oldest modern hydronic heating technology a single-pipe steam system delivers steam to the radiators where the steam gives up its heat and is condensed back to water the radiators and steam supply pipes are pitched so that gravity eventually takes this condensate back down through the steam supply piping to the boiler where it can once again be turned into steam and returned to the radiators
despite its name a radiator does not primarily heat a room by radiationcitation needed if positioned correctly a radiator will create an air convection current in the room which will provide the main heat transfer mechanism it is generally agreed that for the best results a steam radiator should be no more than one to two inches from a wall
single-pipe systems are limited in both their ability to deliver high volumes of steam that is heatcitation needed and the ability to control the flow of steam to individual radiatorscitation needed because closing off the steam supply traps condensate in the radiators because of these limitations single-pipe systems are no longer preferredcitation needed
these systems depend on the proper operation of thermal air-venting valves located on radiators throughout the heated area when the system is not in use these valves are open to the atmosphere and radiators and pipes contain air when a heating cycle begins the boiler produces steam which expands and displaces the air in the system the air exits the system through the air-venting valves on the radiators and on the steam pipes themselves the valves close when they become hot a small amount of alcohol in the valve vaporizes exerting mechanical force to close the valve and prevent steam from leaving the radiator when the heating cycle ends air enters the system to replace the condensing steam the valves reopen when they cool so the air can again be expelled when the next heating cycle starts
some more modern valves can be adjusted to allow for more rapid or slower venting in general valves nearest to the boiler should vent the slowest and valves furthest from the boiler should vent the fastestcitation needed ideally steam should reach each valve and close each and every valve at the same time so that the system can work at maximal efficiency this condition is known as a balanced systemcitation needed
in two-pipe steam systems there is a return path for the condensate and it may involve pumps as well as gravity-induced flow the flow of steam to individual radiators can be modulated using manual or automatic valves
the return piping as the name suggests takes the most direct path back to the boiler
low cost of return piping in most but not all applications and the supply and return piping are separated
this system can be difficult to balance due to the supply line being a different length than the return the further the heat transfer device is from the boiler the more pronounced the pressure difference because of this it is always recommended to minimize the distribution piping pressure drops use a pump with a flat head characteristic include balancing and flow measuring devices at each terminal or branch circuit and use control valves with a high head loss at the terminals
the two pipe reverse return configuration which is sometimes called 'the three pipe system' is different to the two pipe system in the way water returns to the boiler in a two pipe system once the water has left the first radiator it returns to the boiler to be reheated and so with the second and third etc with the two pipe reverse return the return pipe travels to the last radiator in the system before returning to the boiler to be reheated
the advantage with the two pipe reverse return system is that the pipe run to each radiator is about the same this ensures that the frictional resistance to the flow of water in each radiator is the same this allows easy balancing of the system
the installer or repair person cannot trust that every system is self-balancing without properly testing it
very large scale systems can be built using the two-pipe principle for example rather than heating individual radiators the water may be used in the reheat coils of large air handlers to heat an entire floor of a building

modern systems almost always use heated water rather than steam this opens the system to the possibility of also using chilled water to provide air conditioning
in homes the water loop may be as simple as a single pipe that loops the flow through every radiator in a zone in such a system flow to the individual radiators cannot be modulated as all of the water is flowing through every radiator in the zone slightly more complicated systems use a main pipe that flows uninterrupted around the zone the individual radiators tap off a small portion of the flow in the main pipe in these systems individual radiators can be modulated alternatively a number of loops with several radiators can be installed the flow in each loop or zone controlled by a zone valve connected to a thermostat
in most water systems the water is circulated by means of one or more circulator pumps this is in marked contrast to steam systems where the inherent pressure of the steam is sufficient to distribute the steam to remote points in the system a system may be broken up into individual heating zones using either multiple circulator pumps or a single pump and electrically operated zone valves
there have been considerable improvements in the efficiency and therefore the operating costs of a hydronic heating system with the introduction of insulating products
radiator panel system pipes are covered with a fire rated flexible and lightweight elastomeric rubber material designed for thermal insulation slab heating efficiency is improved with the installation of a thermal barrier made of foam there are now many product offerings on the market with different energy ratings and installation methods
most hydronic systems require balancing this involves measuring and setting the flow to achieve an optimal distribution of energy in the system in a balanced system every radiator gets just enough hot water to allow it to heat up fully
domestic home systems may use ordinary tap water but sophisticated commercial systems often add various chemicals to the system water for example these added chemicals may
all hydronic systems must have a means to eliminate air from the system a properly designed air-free system should continue to function normally for many years
air causes irritating system noises as well as interrupting proper heat transfer to and from the circulating fluids in addition unless reduced below an acceptable level the oxygen dissolved in water causes corrosion this corrosion can cause rust and scale to build up on the piping over time these particles can become loose and travel around the pipes reducing or even blocking the flow as well as damaging pump seals and other components
water-loop systems can also experience air problems air found within hydronic water-loop systems may be classified into three forms
various devices such as manual and automatic air vents are used to address free air which floats up to the high points throughout the system automatic air vents contain a valve that is operated by a float when air is present the float drops allowing the valve to open and bleed air out when water reaches fills the valve the float lifts blocking the water from escaping small domestic versions of these valves in older systems are sometimes fitted with a schrader-type air valve fitting and any trapped now-compressed air can be bled from the valve by manually depressing the valve stem until water rather than air begins to emerge
entrained air is air bubbles that travel around in the piping at the same velocity as the water air scoops are one example of products which attempt to remove this type of air
dissolved air is also present in the system water and the amount is determined principally by the temperature and pressure see henry's law of the incoming water on average tap water contains between 8-10% dissolved air by volume
removal of dissolved free and entrained air can only be achieved with a high-efficiency air elimination device that includes a coalescing medium that continually scrubs the air out of the system tangential or centrifugal style air separator devices are limited to removal of free and entrained air only
water expands as it heats and contracts as it cools a water-loop hydronic system must have one or more expansion tanks in the system to accommodate this varying volume of the working fluid these tanks often use a rubber diaphragm pressurised with compressed air the expansion tank accommodates the expanded water by further air compression and helps maintain a roughly constant pressure in the system across the expected change in fluid volume simple cisterns open to atmospheric pressure are also used
hydronic systems are usually connected to a water supply such as the public water supply an automatic valve regulates the amount of water in the system and also prevents backflow of system water and any water treatment chemicals into the water supply
excessive heat or pressure may cause the system to fail at least one combination over-temperature and over-pressure relief valve is always fitted to the system to allow the steam or water to vent to the atmosphere in case of the failure of some mechanism such as the boiler temperature control rather than allowing the catastrophic bursting of the piping radiators or boiler the relief valve usually has a manual operating handle to allow testing and the flushing of contaminants such as grit that may cause the valve to leak under otherwise-normal operating conditions
