designs may be protected if
designs are not protected insofar as their appearance is wholly determined by their technical function or by the need to interconnect with other products to perform a technical function the must-fit exception however modular systems such as lego or meccano may be protected
registered and unregistered community designs are available under eu regulation 62002 which provide a unitary right covering the european community protection for a registered community design is for up to 25 years subject to the payment of renewal fees every five years the unregistered community design lasts for three years after a design is made available to the public and infringement only occurs if the protected design has been copied
national systems of registered designs remain in place alongside the system of community designs registration in a small number of countries is cheaper than community registration and may be more appropriate for smaller manufacturers the benelux countries belgium netherlands luxembourg form a single area with respect to designs administered by the benelux office for intellectual property
national laws are harmonized by the directive on the legal protection of designs the criteria for eligibility and the duration of protection are the same as for registered community designs many member states also protect unregistered design rights under their national law but these are not covered by the directive
the protection of industrial design rights is required by the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights trips arts 25 & 26 to which the european union is a party the regulation on community designs provides for the recognition of the priority date of an application for design right registration in a country which is either a member of the world trade organization or a party to the paris convention for the protection of industrial property

the protection of component parts of complex products in particular spare parts for cars was left to member states' discretion in directive 9871ec given the divergence of practices and opinions as required by that directive the european commission has conducted research on the question which found that spare parts such as wings and bumpers were 6.4–10.3% more expensive in countries where these parts were protected by industrial design rights compared with countries where no such protection existed it has proposed that the design right protection on these parts be abolished throughout the european union
