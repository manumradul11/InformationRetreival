instructional design or instructional systems design isd is the practice of creating instructional experiences which make the acquisition of knowledge and skill more efficient effective and appealing the process consists broadly of determining the state and needs of the learner defining the end goal of instruction and creating some intervention to assist in the transition ideally the process is informed by pedagogically process of teaching and andragogically adult learning tested theories of learning and may take place in student-only teacher-led or community-based settings the outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed there are many instructional design models but many are based on the addie model with the five phases analysis design development implementation and evaluation as a field instructional design is historically and traditionally rooted in cognitive and behavioral psychology though recently constructivism learning theory has influenced thinking in the field


during world war ii a considerable amount of training materials for the military were developed based on the principles of instruction learning and human behavior tests for assessing a learner’s abilities were used to screen candidates for the training programs after the success of military training psychologists began to view training as a system and developed various analysis design and evaluation procedures in 1946 edgar dale outlined a hierarchy of instructional methods organized intuitively by their concreteness
b f skinner's 1954 article the science of learning and the art of teaching suggested that effective instructional materials called programmed instructional materials should include small steps frequent questions and immediate feedback and should allow self-pacing robert f mager popularized the use of learning objectives with his 1962 article preparing objectives for programmed instruction the article describes how to write objectives including desired behavior learning condition and assessment in 1956 a committee led by benjamin bloom published an influential taxonomy with three domains of learning cognitive what one knows or thinks psychomotor what one does physically and affective what one feels or what attitudes one has these taxonomies still influence the design of instruction
robert glaser introduced criterion-referenced measures in 1962 in contrast to norm-referenced tests in which an individual's performance is compared to group performance a criterion-referenced test is designed to test an individual's behavior in relation to an objective standard it can be used to assess the learners’ entry level behavior and to what extent learners have developed mastery through an instructional program
in 1965 robert gagne see below for more information described three domains of learning outcomes cognitive affective psychomotor five learning outcomes verbal information intellectual skills cognitive strategy attitude motor skills and nine events of instruction in the conditions of learning which remain foundations of instructional design practices gagne’s work in learning hierarchies and hierarchical analysis led to an important notion in instruction – to ensure that learners acquire prerequisite skills before attempting superordinate’s ones
in 1967 after analyzing the failure of training material michael scriven suggested the need for formative assessment – eg to try out instructional materials with learners and revise accordingly before declaring them finalized
during the 1970s the number of instructional design models greatly increased and prospered in different sectors in military academia and industry many instructional design theorists began to adopt an information-processing-based approach to the design of instruction david merrill for instance developed component display theory cdt which concentrates on the means of presenting instructional materials presentation techniques
although interest in instructional design continued to be strong in business and the military there was little evolution of id in schools or higher education however educators and researchers began to consider how the personal computer could be used in an educational environment plato programmed logic for automatic teaching operation is one example of how computers began to be integrated into instruction many of the first uses of computers in the classroom were for drill and skill exercises there was a growing interest in how cognitive psychology could be applied to instructional design
the influence of constructivist theory on instructional design became more prominent in the 1990s as a counterpoint to the more traditional cognitive learning theory constructivists believe that learning experiences should be authentic and produce real-world learning environments that allow the learner to construct their own knowledge this emphasis on the learner was a significant departure away from traditional forms of instructional design
performance improvement was also seen as an important outcome of learning that needed to be considered during the design process the world wide web emerged as an online learning tool with hypertext and hypermedia being recognized as good tools for learning as technology advanced and constructivist theory gained popularity technology’s use in the classroom began to evolve from mostly drill and skill exercises to more interactive activities that required more complex thinking on the part of the learner rapid prototyping was first seen during the 1990s in this process an instructional design project is prototyped quickly and then vetted through a series of try and revise cycles this is a big departure from traditional methods of instructional design that took far longer to complete
online learning became common technology advances permitted sophisticated simulations with authentic and realistic learning experiences
robert gagné's work is widely used and cited in the design of instruction as exemplified by more than 130 citations in prominent journals in the field during the period from 1985 through 1990 synthesizing ideas from behaviorism and cognitivism he provided a clear template which is easy to follow for designing instructional events instructional designers who follow gagné's theory will likely have tightly focused efficient instruction
robert gagné classified the types of learning outcomes by asking how learning might be demonstrated his domains and outcomes of learning correspond to standard verbs
according to gagné learning occurs in a series of learning events each of nine learning events are conditions for learning which must be accomplished before the next in order for learning to take place termed  similarly instructional events should mirror the learning events
some educators believe that gagné's taxonomy of learning outcomes and events of instruction oversimplify the learning process by over-prescribing however using them as part of a complete instructional package can assist many educators in becoming more organized and staying focused on the instructional goals
robert gagné’s work has been the foundation of instructional design since the beginning of the 1960s when he conducted research and developed training materials for the military among the first to coin the term instructional design gagné developed some of the earliest instructional design models and ideas these models have laid the groundwork for more present-day instructional design models from theorists like dick carey and carey the dick and carey systems approach model jerold kemp’s instructional design model and david merrill merrill’s first principle of instruction each of these models are based on a core set of learning phases that include 1 activation of prior experience 2 demonstration of skills 3 application of skills and 4 integration or these skills into real world activities the figure below illustrates these five ideas
gagné's main focus for instructional design was how instruction and learning could be systematically connected to the design of instruction he emphasized the design principles and procedures that need to take place for effective teaching and learning his initial ideas along with the ideas of other early instructional designers were outlined in psychological principles in systematic development written by roberts b miller and edited by gagné gagné believed in internal learning and motivation which paved the way for theorists like merrill li and jones who designed the instructional transaction theory reigeluth and stein’s elaboration theory and most notably keller’s arcs model of motivation and design
prior to robert gagné learning was often thought of as a single uniform process there was little or no distinction made between learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem gagné offered an alternative view which developed the idea that different learners required different learning strategies understanding and designing instruction based on a learning style defined by the individual brought about new theories and approaches to teaching gagné 's understanding and theories of human learning added significantly to understanding the stages in cognitive processing and instructions for example gagné argued that instructional designers must understand the characteristics and functions of short-term and long-term memory to facilitate meaningful learning this idea encouraged instructional designers to include cognitive needs as a top-down instructional approach
gagné 1966 defines curriculum as a sequence of content units arranged in such a way that the learning of each unit may be accomplished as a single act provided the capabilities described by specified prior units in the sequence have already been mastered by the learner
his definition of curriculum has been the basis of many important initiatives in schools and other educational environments in the late 1950s and early 1960s gagné had expressed and established an interest in applying theory to practice with particular interest in applications for teaching training and learning increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of practice was of particular concern his ongoing attention to practice while developing theory continues to have an impact on education and training
gagné's work has had a significant influence on american education and military and industrial training gagné was one of the early developers of the concept of instructional systems design which suggests the components of a lesson can be analyzed and should be designed to operate together as an integrated plan for instruction in educational technology and the learning process educational researcher 1974 gagné defined instruction as the set of planned external events which influence the process of learning and thus promote learning
the concept of learning design arrived in the literature of technology for education in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the idea that designers and instructors need to choose for themselves the best mixture of behaviourist and constructivist learning experiences for their online courses but the concept of learning design is probably as old as the concept of teaching learning design might be defined as the description of the teaching-learning process that takes place in a unit of learning eg a course a lesson or any other designed learning event

perhaps the most common model used for creating instructional materials is the addie model this acronym stands for the 5 phases contained in the model analyze design develop implement and evaluate
brief history of addie’s development – the addie model was initially developed by florida state university to explain the processes involved in the formulation of an instructional systems development isd program for military interservice training that will adequately train individuals to do a particular job and which can also be applied to any interservice curriculum development activity the model originally contained several steps under its five original phases analyze design develop implement and evaluation and control whose completion was expected before movement to the next phase could occur over the years the steps were revised and eventually the model itself became more dynamic and interactive than its original hierarchical rendition until its most popular version appeared in the mid-80s as we understand it today
the five phases are listed and explained below
analyze – the first phase of content development is analysis analysis refers to the gathering of information about one’s audience the tasks to be completed how the learners will view the content and the project’s overall goals the instructional designer then classifies the information to make the content more applicable and successful
design – the second phase is the design phase in this phase instructional designers begin to create their project information gathered from the analysis phase in conjunction with the theories and models of instructional design is meant to explain how the learning will be acquired for example the design phase begins with writing a learning objective tasks are then identified and broken down to be more manageable for the designer the final step determines the kind of activities required for the audience in order to meet the goals identified in the analyze phase
develop – the third phase development involves the creation of the activities that will be implemented it is in this stage that the blueprints of the design phase are assembled
implement – after the content is developed it is then implemented this stage allows the instructional designer to test all materials to determine if they are functional and appropriate for the intended audience
evaluate – the final phase evaluate ensures the materials achieved the desired goals the evaluation phase consists of two parts formative and summative assessment the addie model is an iterative process of instructional design which means that at each stage the designer can assess the project's elements and revise them if necessary this process incorporates formative assessment while the summative assessments contain tests or evaluations created for the content being implemented this final phase is vital for the instructional design team because it provides data used to alter and enhance the design
connecting all phases of the model are external and reciprocal revision opportunities as in the internal evaluation phase revisions should and can be made throughout the entire process
most of the current instructional design models are variations of the addie process
an adaptation of the addie model which is used sometimes is a practice known as rapid prototyping
proponents suggest that through an iterative process the verification of the design documents saves time and money by catching problems while they are still easy to fix this approach is not novel to the design of instruction but appears in many design-related domains including software design architecture transportation planning product development message design user experience design etc in fact some proponents of design prototyping assert that a sophisticated understanding of a problem is incomplete without creating and evaluating some type of prototype regardless of the analysis rigor that may have been applied up front in other words up-front analysis is rarely sufficient to allow one to confidently select an instructional model for this reason many traditional methods of instructional design are beginning to be seen as incomplete naive and even counter-productive
however some consider rapid prototyping to be a somewhat simplistic type of model as this argument goes at the heart of instructional design is the analysis phase after you thoroughly conduct the analysis—you can then choose a model based on your findings that is the area where most people get snagged—they simply do not do a thorough-enough analysis part of article by chris bressi on linkedin
another well-known instructional design model is the dick and carey systems approach model the model was originally published in 1978 by walter dick and lou carey in their book entitled the systematic design of instruction
dick and carey made a significant contribution to the instructional design field by championing a systems view of instruction in contrast to defining instruction as the sum of isolated parts the model addresses instruction as an entire system focusing on the interrelationship between context content learning and instruction according to dick and carey components such as the instructor learners materials instructional activities delivery system and learning and performance environments interact with each other and work together to bring about the desired student learning outcomes the components of the systems approach model also known as the dick and carey model are as follows
with this model components are executed iteratively and in parallel rather than linearly
the instructional design model guaranteed learning was formerly known as the instructional development learning system idls the model was originally published in 1970 by peter j esseff phd and mary sullivan esseff phd in their book entitled idls—pro trainer 1 how to design develop and validate instructional materials
peter 1968 & mary 1972 esseff both received their doctorates in educational technology from the catholic university of america under the mentorship of dr gabriel ofiesh a founding father of the military model mentioned above esseff and esseff synthesized existing theories to develop their approach to systematic design guaranteed learning aka instructional development learning system idls in 2015 the drs esseffs created an elearning course to enable participants to take the gl course online under the direction of dr esseff see guaranteedlearningco for further information 2015-3-13
the components of the guaranteed learning model are the following
other useful instructional design models include the smithragan model the morrisonrosskemp model and the oar model of instructional design in higher education as well as wiggins' theory of backward design
learning theories also play an important role in the design of instructional materials theories such as behaviorism constructivism social learning and cognitivism help shape and define the outcome of instructional materials

motivation is defined as an internal drive that activates behavior and gives it direction the term motivation theory is concerned with the process that describe why and how human behavior is activated and directed
motivation concepts intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
john keller has devoted his career to researching and understanding motivation in instructional systems these decades of work constitute a major contribution to the instructional design field first by applying motivation theories systematically to design theory second in developing a unique problem-solving process he calls the arcs motivation
the arcs model of motivational design was created by john keller while he was researching ways to supplement the learning process with motivation the model is based on tolman's and lewin's expectancy-value theory which presumes that people are motivated to learn if there is value in the knowledge presented ie it fulfills personal needs and if there is an optimistic expectation for success the model consists of four main areas attention relevance confidence and satisfaction
attention and relevance according to john keller's arcs motivational theory are essential to learning the first 2 of 4 key components for motivating learners attention and relevance can be considered the backbone of the arcs theory the latter components relying upon the former
attention the attention mentioned in this theory refers to the interest displayed by learners in taking in the conceptsideas being taught this component is split into three categories perceptual arousal using surprise or uncertain situations inquiry arousal offering challenging questions andor problems to answersolve and variability using a variety of resources and methods of teaching within each of these categories john keller has provided further sub-divisions of types of stimuli to grab attention grabbing attention is the most important part of the model because it initiates the motivation for the learners once learners are interested in a topic they are willing to invest their time pay attention and find out more
relevance relevance according to keller must be established by using language and examples that the learners are familiar with the three major strategies john keller presents are goal oriented motive matching and familiarity like the attention category john keller divided the three major strategies into subcategories which provide examples of how to make a lesson plan relevant to the learner learners will throw concepts to the wayside if their attention cannot be grabbed and sustained and if relevance is not conveyed
confidence the confidence aspect of the arcs model focuses on establishing positive expectations for achieving success among learners the confidence level of learners is often correlated with motivation and the amount of effort put forth in reaching a performance objective for this reason it’s important that learning design provides students with a method for estimating their probability of success this can be achieved in the form of a syllabus and grading policy rubrics or a time estimate to complete tasks additionally confidence is built when positive reinforcement for personal achievements is given through timely relevant feedback
satisfaction finally learners must obtain some type of satisfaction or reward from a learning experience this satisfaction can be from a sense of achievement praise from a higher-up or mere entertainment feedback and reinforcement are important elements and when learners appreciate the results they will be motivated to learn satisfaction is based upon motivation which can be intrinsic or extrinsic to keep learners satisfied instruction should be designed to allow them to use their newly learned skills as soon as possible in as authentic a setting as possible
although keller’s arcs model currently dominates instructional design with respect to learner motivation in 2006 hardré and miller proposed a need for a new design model that includes current research in human motivation a comprehensive treatment of motivation integrates various fields of psychology and provides designers the flexibility to be applied to a myriad of situations
hardré proposes an alternate model for designers called the motivating opportunities model or mom hardré’s model incorporates cognitive needs and affective theories as well as social elements of learning to address learner motivation mom has seven key components spelling the acronym ‘success’- situational utilization competence content emotional social and systemic
