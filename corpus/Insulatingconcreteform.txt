insulating concrete form or insulated concrete form icf is a system of formwork for reinforced concrete usually made with a rigid thermal insulation that stays in place as a permanent interior and exterior substrate for walls floors and roofs the forms are interlocking modular units that are dry-stacked without mortar and filled with concrete the units lock together somewhat like lego bricks and create a form for the structural walls or floors of a building icf construction has become commonplace for both low rise commercial and high performance residential construction as more stringent energy efficiency and natural disaster resistant building codes are adopted icfs may be used with frost protected shallow foundations fpsf


the icf construction technique was first developed in europe following world war ii as an inexpensive and durable way to rebuild damaged structures the first patent for an insulated stay-in-place formwork for concrete was registered in the early 1940s using recycled waste wood and cement as the insulating material this patent was registered by august schnell and alex bosshard in switzerland the first polystyrene icf forms were developed in the late 1960s with the expiration of the original patent and the advent of modern foam plastics canadian contractor werner gregori filed the first patent for a foam concrete form in 1966 with a block measuring 16 inches high by 48 inches long with a tongue-and-groove interlock metal ties and a waffle-grid core
the adoption of icf construction has steadily increased since the 1970s though it was initially hampered by lack of awareness building codes and confusion caused by many different manufacturers selling slightly different icf designs rather than focusing on industry standardization icf construction is now part of most building codes and accepted in most jurisdictions in the developed world
insulating concrete forms are manufactured from any of the following materials
reinforcing steel bars rebar are usually placed inside the forms before concrete is poured to give the concrete flexural strength similar to bridges and high-rise buildings made of reinforced concrete like other concrete formwork the forms are filled with concrete in 1-foot to 12-foot high lifts to manage the concrete pressure and reduce the risk of blowouts
after the concrete has cured the forms are left in place permanently to provide a variety of benefits depending on materials used
insulating concrete forms are commonly categorized in two manners organizations whose first concern relates to the concrete classify them first by the shape of the concrete inside the form organizations whose first concern relates to the fabrication of the forms classify them first by the characteristics of the forms themselves
for flat wall system icfs the concrete has the shape of a flat wall of solid reinforced concrete similar to the shape of a concrete wall constructed using removable forms
for screen grid system icfs the concrete has the shape of the metal in a screen with horizontal and vertical channels of reinforced concrete separated by areas of solid form material
for waffle grid system icfs the concrete has the shape of a hybrid between screen grid and flat wall system concrete with a grid of thicker reinforced concrete and having thinner concrete in the center areas where a screen grid would have solid icf material
for post and lintel system icfs the concrete has a horizontal member called a lintel only at the top of the wall horizontal concrete at the bottom of the wall is often present in the form of the building's footer or the lintel of the wall below and vertical members called posts between the lintel and the surface on which the wall is resting
for block icfs the exterior shape of the icf is similar to that of a concrete masonry unit although icf blocks are often larger in size as they are made from a material having a lower specific gravity very frequently the edges of block icfs are made to interlock reducing or eliminating the need for the use of a bonding material between the blocks
panel icfs have the flat rectangular shape of a section of flat wall they are often the height of the wall and have a width limited by the manipulability of the material at larger sizes and by the general usefulness of the panel size for constructing walls
plank icfs have the size of block icfs in one dimension and panel icfs in the other dimension
icf walls have much lower rates of acoustic transmission standard thickness icf walls have shown sound transmission coefficients stc between 46 and 72 compared to 36 for standard fiberglass insulation and drywall the level of sound attenuation achieved is a function of wall thickness mass component materials and air tightness
icf walls can have four- to six-hour fire resistance rating and negligible surface burning properties it is worth pointing out that the international building code 2603.5.2 requires plastic foam insulation eg polystyrene foam polyurethane foam to be separated from the building interior by a thermal barrier eg drywall regardless of the fire barrier provided by the central concrete forms made from cement bonded - wood fibers eg polystyrene beads eg or air ie cellular concrete - eg have a fire rating inherently
because they are generally constructed without a sheet plastic vapor barrier icf walls can regulate humidity levels mitigate the potential for mold and facilitate a more comfortable interior while maintaining high thermal performance
icf walls can be made with a variety of recycled materials that can minimize the environmental impact of the building the large volume of concrete used in icf walls has been criticized as concrete production is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions
because the entire interior space of icf walls is continuously occupied no gaps as can occur between blown or fiberglass insulation and a wood frame wall they pose more difficulty for casual transit by insects and vermin additionally while plastic foam forms can occasionally be tunneled through interior concrete wall and the portland cement of cement-bonded type forms create a much more challenging barrier to insects and vermin than do walls made of wood
when designing a building to be constructed with icf walls consideration must be given to supporting the weight of any walls not resting directly on other walls or the building's foundation consideration must also be given to the understanding that the load bearing part of an icf wall is the concrete which without special preparations does not extend in any direction to the edge of the form for grid and post & lintel systems the placement of vertical members of the concrete must be organized in such a fashion eg starting at opposite corners or breaks eg doorways and working to meet in unbroken wall as to properly transfer load from the lintel or bond beam to the surface supporting the wall
icf construction is less demanding owing to its modularity less-skilled labor can be employed to lay the icf forms though careful consideration must be made when pouring the concrete to make sure it consolidates fully and cures evenly without cracking unlike traditional wood beam construction no additional structural support other than temporary scaffolding is required for openings doors windows or utilities though modifying the structure after the concrete cures requires special concrete cutting tools
icf walls are conventionally placed on a monolithic slab with embedded rebar dowels connecting the walls to the foundation
icf decking is becoming an increasingly popular addition to general icf wall construction icf decking weighs up to 40% less than standard concrete flooring and provides superior insulation icf decking can also be designed in conjunction with icf walls to form a continuous monolithic structure joined together by rebar icf deck roofs are less common as it is difficult to pour concrete on an angled surface
icf walls are constructed one row at a time usually starting at the corners and working toward the middle of the walls end blocks are then cut to fit so as to waste the least material possible as the wall rises blocks are staggered to avoid long vertical seams that can weaken the polystyrene formwork structure frames known as bucks are placed around openings to give added strength to the openings and to serve as attachment points for windows and doors
interior and exterior finishes and facades are affixed directly to the icf surface or tie ends depending on the type of icf brick and masonry facades require an extended ledge or shelf angle at the main floor level but otherwise no modifications are necessary interior icf polystyrene wall surfaces must be covered with drywall panels or other wall coatings during the first months immediately after construction minor problems with interior humidity may be evident as the concrete cures which can damage the drywall dehumidification can be accomplished with small residential dehumidifiers or using the building's air conditioning system
depending on the experience of the contractor and their quality of work improperly installed exterior foam insulation could be easy access for groundwater and insects to help prevent these problems some manufacturers make insecticide-treated foam blocks and promote installation of drainage sheeting and other methods for waterproofing drain tiles are installed to eliminate water
plumbing and electrical conduit can be placed inside the forms and poured into place though settling problems could cause pipes to break creating costly repairs for this reason plumbing and conduit as well as electrical cables are usually embedded directly into the foam before the wall coverings are applied a hot knife or electric chainsaw is commonly used to create openings in the foam to lay piping and cabling electrical cables are inserted into the icf using a cable punch while icfs made from other materials are typically cut or routed with simple carpentry tools versions of simple carpentry tools suitable for cement-bonded type forms are made for similar use with autoclaved aerated concrete
the initial cost of using icfs rather than conventional construction techniques is sensitive to the price of materials and labor but building using icf can generally add 3 to 5 percent in construction cost over building using wood frame in most cases icf construction will cost about 40% less than conventional basement construction because of the labor savings from combining multiple steps into one step above grade icf construction is typically more expensive but when adding large openings icf construction becomes very cost effective large openings in conventional construction require large headers and supporting posts whereas icf construction reduces the cost as only reinforcing steel is needed directly around the opening
icf construction can allow up to 60% smaller heating and cooling units to service the same floor area which can cut the cost of the final house by an estimated $0.75 per square foot so the estimated net extra cost can be as much as $0.25 to $3.25 icf homes can also qualify for tax credits further lowering the costs
icf buildings are less expensive over time as they require less energy to heat and cool the same size space compared to a variety of other common construction methods additionally insurance costs can be much lower as icf homes are much less susceptible to damage from earthquakes floods hurricanes fires and other natural disasters maintenance and upkeep costs are also lessened as icf buildings do not contain wood which can rot over time or be attacked by insects and rodents
icf construction is great in seismic and hurricane-prone areas it provides strength durability excellent sound insulation and airtightness icf construction is ideal in moderate and mixed climates with significant daily temperature variations in buildings designed to benefit from thermal mass strategies
the typical insulating value r-value of icfs range from r-12 to r-26 which can be a good r-value for walls in a moderate or hot climate but falls short of the best for high-efficient buildings in cold climates
