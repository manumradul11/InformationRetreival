in design human–computer interaction and software development interaction design often abbreviated ixd is defined as the practice of designing interactive digital products environments systems and servicesxxxi1 like many other design fields interaction design also has an interest in form but its main focus is on behaviour1 what clearly marks interaction design as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field is that it involves synthesising and imagining things as they might be more so than focusing on how things arexviii
interaction design is heavily focused on satisfying the needs and desires of the majority of people who will use the productxviii other disciplines like software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical stakeholders of a project


the term interaction design was first coined by bill moggridge and bill verplank in the mid-1980s it would be another 10 years before other designers rediscovered the term and started using itxviii to verplank it was an adaptation of the computer science term user interface design to the industrial design profession to moggridge it was an improvement over soft-face which he had coined in 1984 to refer to the application of industrial design to products containing software
the first academic program officially named as interaction design was established at carnegie mellon university in 1994 as master of design in interaction design when the program started it focused mostly on screen interfaces but today more on the big picture aspects of interaction — people organizations culture service and system
in 1990 gillian crampton smith founded the computer-related design ma at the royal college of art rca in london which changed to design interactions in 2005 headed by professor anthony dunne in 2001 crampton smith helped found the interaction design institute ivrea a small institute in northern italy dedicated solely to interaction design the institute moved to milan in october 2005 and merged courses with domus academy in 2007 some of the people originally involved with idii set up the copenhagen institute of interaction design ciid after ivrea gillian crampton smith and philip tabor added the interaction design ixd programme in the visual and multimedia communication at iuav university of venice italy between 2006 and 2014
in 1998 the swedish foundation for strategic research founded the interactive institute - a swedish research institute in the field of interaction design
today interaction design is taught in many schools worldwide it is also a topic frequently discussed at conferences such as gamification 2013 held at the university of waterloo stratford campus where author stephen p anderson discussed seductive interaction design a fresh approach to designing sites and interactions based on the stages of seduction
goal-oriented design or goal-directed™ design is concerned most significantly with satisfying the needs and desires of the people who will interact with a product or servicexviii
alan cooper argues in the inmates are running the asylum that we need to take a new approach to how interactive software based problems are solved1 the problems faced with designing computer based interfaces are fundamentally different from the challenges we face when designing interfaces for products that do not include software eg hammers alan introduces the concept of cognitive friction whereby we treat things as human when they are significantly complex enough that we cannot always understand how they behave computer interfaces are sufficiently complex as to be treated this way22
it is argued that we must truly understand the goals of a user both personal and objective in order to solve the problem in the best way possible and that the current approach is much oriented towards solving individual problems from the perspective of a business or other interested parties
personas are archetypes that describe the various goals and observed behavior patterns among your potential users and customers 
a persona encapsulates and explains the most critical behavioral data in a way that designers and stakeholders can understand remember and relate to unlike simple lists of findings or other types of models personas use storytelling to engage the social and emotional aspects of our brains which helps team members either visualize the best product behavior or see why the recommended design is good 
the cognitive dimensions framework provides a specialized vocabulary to evaluate and modify particular design solutions cognitive dimensions are designed as a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality rather than an in-depth detailed description they provide a common vocabulary for discussing many factors in notation ui or programming language design
dimensions provide high-level descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it such as consistency error-proneness hard mental operations viscosity or premature commitment these concepts aid the creation of new designs from existing ones through design maneuvers that alter the position of the design within a particular dimension
throughout the process of interaction design designers must be aware of key aspects in their designs that influence emotional responses in target users the need for products to convey positive emotions and avoid negative ones is critical to product success these aspects include positive negative motivational learning creative social and persuasive influences to name a few one method that can help convey such aspects is the use of expressive interfaces in software for example the use of dynamic icons animations and sound can help communicate a state of operation creating a sense of interactivity and feedback interface aspects such as fonts color palette and graphical layouts can also influence an interface's perceived effectiveness studies have shown that affective aspects can affect a user's perception of usability
emotional and pleasure theories exist to explain people's responses to the use of interactive products these include don norman's emotional design model patrick jordan's pleasure model and mccarthy and wright's technology as experience framework
the dimensions of interaction design was first introduced in the introduction of the book designing interactions gillian crampton smith stated that there were four dimensions to an interaction design language a fifth dimension was added by kevin silver
this dimension defines the interactions words are the interaction that users use to interact with
the visual representations are the things that the user interacts with on the interface these may include but not limited to typography diagrams icons and other graphics
the space with which the user interacts is the third dimension of interaction design it defines the space or objects with which or within which users interact
the time with which the user interacts with the interface some examples of this are content that changes over time such as sound video or animation
the behavior defines the users actions in reaction to the interface and how they respond to it
the interaction design association ixda was created in 2003 to serve the international interaction design community the organization currently has 50000 members and 140 local groups around the world it produces interaction the annual interaction design conference and the interaction awards
