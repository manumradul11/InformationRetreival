interior architecture is the design of a space which has been created by structural boundaries and the human interaction within these boundaries it can also be the initial design and plan for use then later redesign to accommodate a changed purpose or a significantly revised design for adaptive reuse of the building shell the latter is often part of sustainable architecture practices conserving resources through recycling a structure by adaptive redesign generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design form and practice interior architecture is the process through which the interiors of buildings are designed concerned with all aspects of the human uses of structural spaces put simply interior architecture is the design of an interior in architectural terms
interior architecture may refer to


although the original spatial hierarchy of a building is always established by its first architect subsequent iterations of the interior may not be and for obvious reasons older structures are often modified by designers of a different generation according to society’s changing needs as our cities evolve this process often re-semanticizes the building as a consequence and is predicated on the notion that buildings can never really be complete and unalterable
an altered building may look the same on the exterior but its interior may be completely different spatially the interior architect must therefore be sensitive not only to the place of the building in its physical and socio-political context but to the temporal requirements of changing owners and users in this sense if the building has good bones the original architectural idea is therefore the first iteration of an internal spatial hierarchy for that structure after which others are bound to follow
cities are now dense with such buildings perhaps originally built as banks that are now restaurants perhaps industrial mills that are now loft apartments or even railway stations that have become art galleries in each case the collective memory of the shape and character of the city is generally held to be more desirable than the possibility of a new building on the same site although clearly economic forces apply it is also possible to speculate that there might well be further new interiors for these structures in future years but for each alteration the technical and technological expertise of the era will determine the extent to which the building is modified in its building life cycle
certain structure's interiors remain unaltered over time due to historic preservation unchanged use or financial limitations nevertheless most buildings have only three possible long-range internal futures first designated significantly important to maintain visually unchanged only accommodating unseen modern utilities access and structural stabilization and restoration needs second demolished to make way for a new building on the same site or abandoned becoming ruins finally redesigned and altered to accommodate new uses
there are many different degrees of alteration – a minor one to enable the building to conform to new legal codes is likely to prolong the first or indeed later iteration of interior space but a major alteration such as the retention of only the facade is to all intents and purposes a new building all possibilities within and between the two extremes are the domain of the interior architect
if the practice of architecture is concerned with the art and science of new building then the practice of interior architecture is concerned with the alteration of existing buildings for new uses
a critical part in the evolution of interior architecture and design is sustainability and consciously thinking of the environment and the materials being sourced- energy use site selection water usage and material selection leigh bacon this sub-category of interior architecture focuses on finding creative and holistic ways of building new or retro fitting existing structures that have little to no impact on the environment the eco-friendly movement became an important issue around the 1970's when the major energy crisis struck making individuals aware of their contributions and what can be done to help lighten the impacts bstone sustainability in interior architecture has really taken off in the last few decades with the help and advancements of technology discovering new materials and efficient concepts that still lend the aesthetically pleasing aspect of a design in past years when it came to eco-design it had a stale and lack of luxury elegance and overall design which inevitably received the reputation of being a hippies style or way of living this is far from the case today with the overall known importance of being environmentally responsible having an abundant amount of material options and wanting to withhold an aesthetic design sustainable design is now a preferred and desired way of thinking and building that has and will be a ever-expanding and growing field
median annual wages of wage-and-salary architects were $70320 in may 2008 the middle 50 percent earned between $53480 and $91870 the lowest 10 percent earned less than $41320 and the highest 10 percent earned more than $119220 those just starting their internships can expect to earn considerably less
earnings of partners in established architectural firms may fluctuate because of changing business conditions some architects may have difficulty establishing their own practices and may go through a period when their expenses are greater than their income requiring substantial financial resources
many firms pay tuition and fees toward continuing education requirements for their employees
education in interior architecture should include the study of historic architectural and design styles building codes and safety preserving and restoring old buildings drawing plans of original designs and building physical and virtual computer-based models the field of interior architecture has a lot in common with interior design and decorating however it typically focuses on architecture and construction students of both fields learn to design comfortable safe and useful indoor spaces from downtown penthouses to high school classrooms a student of interior architecture will learn about much more than artistic concerns such as choosing which style of furnishings works well in an open loft-like apartment study will also include information on technical issues such as seismic retrofitting making old buildings safe from earthquakes
interior architecture stands at the intersection of architecture design of the built environment and conservation interior architecture programs address the design issues intrinsic to the re-use and transformation of existing structures through both an innovative and progressive approach
the national center for education statistics states that the definition of a degree program in interior architecture is a program that prepares individuals to apply architectural principles in the design of structural interiors for living recreational and business purposes and to function as professional interior architects study includes instruction in architecture occupational and safety standards structural systems design heating and cooling systems design interior design specific end-use applications and professional responsibilities and standards
in addition to earning a degree in interior architecture general licensure is required to work within the united states and some states have further licensing requirements in many european countries and in australia the use of the title interior architect is legally regulated this means that a practicing professional cannot use the title of interior architect unless they complete the requirements for becoming a registered or licensed architect as well as completing a degree program
degree programs in interior architecture include
