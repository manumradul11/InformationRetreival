interior design is the art or process of designing the interior often including the exterior of a room or building an interior designer is someone who coordinates and manages such projects interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development communicating with the stakeholders of a project and the management and execution of the design
interior design is the process of shaping the experience of interior space through the manipulation of spatial volume as well as surface treatment


in the past interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building the profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes the pursuit of effective use of space user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession the profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of interior decorator a term commonly used in the us the term is less common in the uk where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore strictly speaking not yet officially a profession
in ancient india architects used to work as interior designers this can be seen from the references of vishwakarma the architect - one of the gods in indian mythology additionally the sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen in palaces built in 17th century india
in ancient egypt soul houses or models of houses were placed in tombs as receptacles for food offerings from these it is possible to discern details about the interior design of different residences throughout the different egyptian dynasties such as changes in ventilation porticoes columns loggias windows and doors
throughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker or an employed upholsterer or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings
in the mid- to late-19th century interior design services expanded greatly as the middle class in industrial countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status large furniture firms began to branch out into general interior design and management offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles this business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914 when this role was increasingly usurped by independent often amateur designers this paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century
in the 1850s and 1860s upholsterers began to expand their business remits they framed their business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public to meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as offices hotels and public buildings these businesses became much larger and more complex employing builders joiners plasterers textile designers artists and furniture designers as well as engineers and technicians to fulfil the job firms began to publish and circulate catalogs with prints for different lavish styles to attract the attention of expanding middle classes
as department stores increased in number and size retail spaces within shops were furnished in different styles as examples for customers one particularly effective advertising tool was to set up model rooms at national and international exhibitions in showrooms for the public to see some of the pioneering firms in this regard were waring & gillow james shoolbred mintons and holland & sons these traditional high-quality furniture making firms began to play an important role as advisers to unsure middle class customers on taste and style and began taking out contracts to design and furnish the interiors of many important buildings in britain
this type of firm emerged in america after the civil war the herter brothers founded by two german emigre brothers began as an upholstery warehouse and became one of the first firms of furniture makers and interior decorators with their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops herter brothers were prepared to accomplish every aspect of interior furnishing including decorative paneling and mantels wall and ceiling decoration patterned floors and carpets and draperies
a pivotal figure in popularizing theories of interior design to the middle class was the architect owen jones one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century jones first project was his most important - in 1851 he was responsible for not only the decoration of joseph paxtonâ€™s gigantic crystal palace for the great exhibition but also for the arrangement of the exhibits within he chose a controversial palette of red yellow and blue for the interior ironwork and despite initial negative publicity in the newspapers was eventually unveiled by queen victoria to much critical acclaim his most significant work was the grammar of ornament 1856 in which jones formulated 37 key principles of interior design and decoration
jones was employed by some of the leading interior design firms of the day in the 1860s he worked in collaboration with the london firm jackson & graham to produce furniture and other fittings for high-profile clients including art collector alfred morrison and the khedive of egypt ismail pasha
in 1882 the london directory of the post office listed 80 interior decorators some of the most distinguished companies of the period were crace waring & gillow and holland & sons famous decorators employed by these firms included thomas edward collcutt edward william godwin charles barry gottfried semper and george edmund street
by the turn of the 20th century amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design english feminist author mary haweis wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers she advocated the individual adoption of a particular style tailor made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer
the move towards decoration as a separate artistic profession unrelated to the manufacturers and retailers received an impetus with the 1899 formation of the institute of british decorators with john dibblee crace as its president it represented almost 200 decorators around the country by 1915 the london directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators of which 10 were women rhoda and agnes garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874 the importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of william morris in 1876 their work - suggestions for house decoration in painting woodwork and furniture - spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience
by 1900 the situation was described by the illustrated carpenter and builder
in america candace wheeler was one of the first woman interior designers and helped encourage a new style of american design she was instrumental in the development of art courses for women in a number of major american cities and was considered a national authority on homedesign an important influence on the new profession was the decoration of houses a manual of interior design written by edith wharton with architect ogden codman in 1897 in america in the book the authors denounced victorian-style interior decoration and interior design especially those rooms that were decorated with heavy window curtains victorian bric-a-brac and overstuffed furniture they argued that such rooms emphasized upholstery at the expense of proper space planning and architectural design and were therefore uncomfortable and rarely used the book is considered a seminal work and its success led to the emergence of professional decorators working in the manner advocated by its authors most notably elsie de wolfe
elsie de wolfe was one of the first female interior designers rejecting the victorian style she grew up with she chose a more vibrant scheme along with more comfortable furniture in the home her designs were light with fresh colors and delicate chinoiserie furnishings as opposed to the victorian preference of heavy red drapes and upholstery dark wood and intensely patterned wallpapers her designs were also more practical she eliminated the clutter that occupied the victorian home enabling people to entertain more guests comfortably in 1905 de wolfe was commissioned for the interior design of the colony club on madison avenue its interiors garnered her recognition almost over night she compiled her ideas into her widely read 1913 book the house in good taste
in england syrie maugham became a legendary interior designer credited with designing the first all-white room starting her career in the early 1910s her international reputation soon grew she later expanded her business to new york and chicago born during the victorian era a time characterized by dark colors and small spaces she instead designed rooms filled with light and furnished in multiple shades of white and mirrored screens in addition to mirrored screens her trademark pieces included books covered in white vellum cutlery with white porcelain handles console tables with plaster palm-frond shell or dolphin bases upholstered and fringed sleigh beds fur carpets dining chairs covered in white leather and lamps of graduated glass balls and wreaths
the interior design profession became more established after world war ii from the 1950s onwards spending on the home increased interior design courses were established requiring the publication of textbooks and reference sources historical accounts of interior designers and firms distinct from the decorative arts specialists were made available organisations to regulate education qualifications standards and practices etc were established for the profession
interior design was previously seen as playing a secondary role to architecture it also has many connections to other design disciplines involving the work of architects industrial designers engineers builders craftsmen etc for these reasons the government of interior design standards and qualifications was often incorporated into other professional organisations that involved design organisations such as the chartered society of designers established in the uk in 1986 and the american designers institute founded in 1938 were established as organisations that governed various areas of design
it was not until later that specific representation for the interior design profession was developed the us national society of interior designers was established in 1957 while in the uk the interior decorators and designers association was established in 1966 across europe other organisations such as the finnish association of interior architects 1949 were being established and in 1994 the international interior design association was founded
ellen mazur thomson author of origins of graphic design in america 1997 determined that professional status is achieved through education self-imposed standards and professional gate-keeping organizations having achieved this interior design became an accepted profession
interior design is the art and science of understanding people's behavior to create functional spaces within a building decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things in short interior designers may decorate but decorators do not design
interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning functional design and the effective use of space as compared to interior decorating an interior designer can undertake projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as window and door positioning acoustics and lighting although an interior designer may create the layout of a space they may not alter load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a structural engineer interior designers often work directly with architects engineers and contractors
interior designers must be highly skilled in order to create interior environments that are functional safe and adhere to building codes regulations and ada requirements they go beyond the selection of color palettes and furnishings and apply their knowledge to the development of construction documents occupancy loads healthcare regulations and sustainable design principles as well as the management and coordination of professional services including mechanical electrical plumbing and life safety â€“ all to ensure that people can work live and learn in an innocuous environment that is also aesthetically pleasing
an interior designer may wish to specialize in a particular type of interior design in order to develop technical knowledge specific to that area types of interior design include residential design commercial design hospitality design healthcare design universal design exhibition design furniture design and spatial branding the profession of interior design is relatively new constantly evolving and often confusing to the public it is a creative profession that is consistently changing and evolving it is not an artistic pursuit and relies on research from many fields to provide a well-trained understanding of how people are influenced by their environments
residential design is the design of the interior of private residences as this type design is very specific for individual situations the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area of interior design the interior designer may work on the project from the initial planning stage or may work on the remodelling of an existing structure it is often a very involved process that takes months to fine-tune and create a space with the vision of the client fine examples of contemporary designers include kelly hoppen and david collins who in keeping with current trends have both a strong media presence and successful independent business
commercial design encompasses a wide range of sub specialties
other areas of specialization include amusement and theme park design museum and exhibition design event design including ceremonies weddings baby and bridal showers parties conventions and concerts interior and prop styling craft styling tablescape design theatre and performance design stage and set design scenic design and production design for film and television beyond those interior designers particularly those with graduate education can specialize in healthcare design gerontological design educational facility design and other areas that require specialized knowledge some university programs offer graduate studies in theses and other areas for example both cornell university and the university of florida offer interior design graduate programs in environment and behavior studies within this program at the university of florida students may choose a specific focus such as retirement community design under dr nichole campbell co-housing dr maruja torres or theft prevention by design prof candy carmel-gilfilen campbell 2012 personal communication
there are various paths that one can take to become a professional interior designer all of these paths involve some form of training working with a successful professional designer is an informal method of training and has previously been the most common method of education in many states however this path alone cannot lead to licensing as a professional interior designer training through an institution such as a college art or design school or university is a more formal route to professional practice
in the uk and the us several university degree courses are now available including those on interior architecture taking three or four years to complete
a formal education program particularly one accredited by or developed with a professional organization of interior designers can provide training that meets a minimum standard of excellence and therefore gives a student an education of a high standard there are also university graduate and phd programs available for those seeking further training in a specific design specialization ie gerontological or healthcare design or those wishing to teach interior design at the university level
in china seldom does university offer interior design as a major instead of offering one or two elective classes as a result of losing official government supports education in interior design requires people to take some tutoring classes from some private institutions if they are interested in this area and want to study however the educational quality is poor on the other side the certification test of interior design in china is different from us because china only requires basic skills and knowledge
there are a wide range of working conditions and employment opportunities within interior design large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as employees on regular working hours designers for smaller firms usually work on a contract or per-job basis self-employed designers which make up 26% of interior designers usually work the most hours interior designers often work under stress to meet deadlines stay on budget and meet clients' needs
in some cases licensed professionals review the work and sign it before submitting the design for approval by clients or construction permisioning the need for licensed review and signature varies by locality relevant legislation and scope of work their work can involve significant travel to visit different locations however with technology development the process of contacting clients and communicating design alternatives has become easier and requires less travel they also renovate a space to satisfy the specific taste for a client
the art deco style began in europe in the early years of the 20th century with the waning of art nouveau the term art deco was taken from the exposition internationale des arts decoratifs et industriels modernes a worldâ€™s fair held in paris in 1925 art deco rejected many traditional classical influences in favour of more streamlined geometric forms and metallic color the art deco style influenced all areas of design especially interior design because it was the first style of interior decoration to spotlight new technologies and materials
art deco style is mainly based on geometric shapes streamlining and clean lines the style offered a sharp cool look of mechanized living utterly at odds with anything that came before
art deco rejected traditional materials of decoration and interior design opting instead to use more unusual materials such as chrome glass stainless steel shiny fabrics mirrors aluminium lacquer inlaid wood sharkskin and zebra skin the use of harder metallic materials was chosen to celebrate the machine age these materials reflected the dawning modern age that was ushered in after the end of the first world war the innovative combinations of these materials created contrasts that were very popular at the time - for example the mixing together of highly polished wood and black lacquer with satin and furs the barber shop in the austin reed store in london was designed by p j westwood it was soon regarded as the trendiest barber shop in britain due to its use of metallic materials
the color themes of art deco consisted of metallic color neutral color bright color and black and white in interior design cool metallic colors including silver gold metallic blue charcoal grey and platinum tended to predominate serge chermayeff a russian-born british designer made extensive use of cool metallic colors and luxurious surfaces in his room schemes his 1930 showroom design for a british dressmaking firm had a silver-grey background and black mirrored-glass wall panels
black and white was also a very popular color scheme during the 1920s and 1930s black and white checkerboard tiles floors and wallpapers were very trendy at the time as the style developed bright vibrant colors became popular as well
art deco furnishings and lighting fixtures had a glossy luxurious appearance with the use of inlaid wood and reflective finishes the furniture pieces often had curved edges geometric shapes and clean lines art deco lighting fixtures tended to make use of stacked geometric patterns
modern design grew out of the decorative arts mostly from the art deco in the early 20th century one of the first to introduce this style was frank lloyd wright who hadn't become hugely popularized until completing the house called fallingwater in the 1930s modern art reached its peak in the 1950s and 60s which is why designers and decorators today may refer to modern design as being mid-century modern art does not refer to the era or age of design modern art is not the same as contemporary design which is a term that interior designers apply to a shifting group of recent styles and trends modern designs is defined by its own trends which has gone unchanged for decades
majlis painting also called nagash painting is the decoration of the majlis or front parlor of traditional arabic homes in the asir province of saudi arabia and adjoining parts of yemen these wall paintings an arabesque form of mural or fresco show various geometric designs in bright colors called 'nagash' in arabic the wall paintings were a mark of pride for a woman in her house 
the geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the areaâ€™s textile and weaving patterns in contrast with the sobriety of architecture and decoration in the rest of arabia exuberant color and ornamentation characterize those of 'asir the painting extends into the house over the walls and doors up the staircases and onto the furniture itself when a house is being painted women from the community help each other finish the job the building then displays their shared taste and knowledge mothers pass these on to their daughters this artwork is based on a geometry of straight lines and suggests the patterns common to textile weaving with solid bands of different colors certain motifs reappear such as the triangular mihrab or 'niche' and the palmette in the past paint was produced from mineral and vegetable pigments cloves and alfalfa yielded green blue came from the indigo plant red came from pomegranates and a certain mud paintbrushes were created from the tough hair found in a goat's tail today however women use modern manufactured paint to create new looks which have become an indicator of social and economic change
women in the asir province often complete the decoration and painting of the house interior you could tell a familyâ€™s wealth by the paintings um abdullah says if they didnâ€™t have much money the wife could only paint the motholath the basic straight simple lines in patterns of three to six repetitions in red green yellow and brown when women did not want to paint the walls themselves they could barter with other women who would do the work several saudi women have become famous as majlis painters such as fatima abou gahas
the interior walls of the home are brightly painted by the women who work in defined patterns with lines triangles squares diagonals and tree-like patterns some of the large triangles represent mountains zigzag lines stand for water and also for lightning small triangles especially when the widest area is at the top are found in pre-islamic representations of female figures that the small triangles found in the wall paintings in â€˜asir are called banat may be a cultural remnant of a long-forgotten past 
courtyards and upper pillared porticoes are principal features of the best nadjdi architecture in addition to the fine incised plaster wood jiss and painted window shutters which decorate the reception rooms good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light delicate and airy it is usually around the majlis around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs against cushions doughty wondered if this parquetting of jis this gypsum fretwork all adorning and unenclosed originated from india however the najd fretwork seems very different from that seen in the eastern province and oman which are linked to indian traditions and rather resembles the motifs and patterns found in ancient mesopotamia the rosette the star the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns and can be found all over the middle east of antiquity al-qassim province seems to be the home of this art and there it is normally worked in hard white plaster though what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth in riyadh examples can be seen in unadorned clay
