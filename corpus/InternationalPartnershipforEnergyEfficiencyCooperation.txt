the partnership for energy efficiency cooperation ipeec is a high-level international forum which includes developed and developing countries its purpose is to enhance global cooperation in the field of energy efficiency ee and to facilitate policies that yield energy efficiency gains across all sectors globally its foundation in may 2009 represents a key milestone in the improvement of energy efficiency generally referred to as the use of the least amount of energy per unit of production andor population the ipeec promotes energy efficiency worldwide by exchanging information related to energy efficiency developing partnerships between energy efficiency actors and supporting energy efficient initiatives ipeec supported initiatives are open to both member and non-member nations as well as the private sector 


at the gleneagles 2005 and the stpetersburg 2006 summits the group of eight g8 industrialized countries emphasized the need for global cooperation in the field of 33rd g8 summit at heiligendamm in june 2007 the g8 approved an eu proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency and decided to explore the most efficient way to promote energy efficiency worldwide jointly with the international energy agency iea
since its creation by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 1974 the iea has promoted energy efficiency however its members are all developed countries the growing economic interdependence amongst nations the increasingly globalized energy market and the environmental issues affecting every country make the idea of a worldwide forum particularly relevant ipeec provides exactly such a forum that opens up a dialogue on energy economic and environment issues between developed and developing nations as well as the private sector
one year after the heiligendamm summit on 8 june 2008 in aomori at the energy ministerial meeting hosted by japan during its g8 presidency the energy ministers from the g8 and from china india south korea and the european community agreed to establish the ipeec in the aomori declaration signed on june 8 2008 the energy ministers acknowledged that all countries  both developed and developing share common interests for improving their energy efficiency performance and that developed countries need to play an important role in cooperation with developing countries accelerating dissemination and transfer of best practices and efficient technologies
on may 24 2009 in rome the g8 members china south korea brazil and mexico signed the terms of reference of the ipeec this group signature officially created the ipeec the same day the representatives of these countries also signed the memorandum' asking the iea to host the ipeec secretariat
the 9th meeting of asia-pacific economic cooperation apec energy ministers in japan in 2010 resulted in the fukui declaration that supported ipeec’s goal by stating that improving energy efficiency is one of the quickest greenest and most cost-effective ways to address energy security economic growth and climate change challenges at the same time
meer meer making energy efficiency real is a database that provides a list of multilateral and bilateral energy efficiency initiatives implemented in ipeec’s member countries such as brazil china india mexico russia and south africa this continuously updated database has the objective to map all the energy efficiency programs so that it can analyse how these energy efficiency programs can complement national energy efficiency policies
sectorial initiatives appliances buildings and industries are the three sectors that ipeec is looking into as these three account for a major portion of energy consumption ipeec’s aim in these sectors is to implement appropriate policies and technical innovations that will promote energy efficiency
institutional capacity building and training ipeec works to develop meaningful partnerships and networks and to pass on the effectiveness of certain energy efficiency policies ipeec conducts conferences webinars and publishes newsletters this increased awareness can improve the design implementation and evaluation of new policies and programs ipeec’s website resources help build stakeholder capacity to implement energy efficient measures
partnerships and networks ipeec partnerships and networks amongst the stakeholders promote information exchange on effective regulations market-based instruments and financial instruments this enhances awareness of best practices lessons learnt and best available technologies for energy efficiency improvements
policies regulations and finance mechanisms ipeec promotes effective policies and regulations to accelerate market transformation that can improve economy-wide energy efficiency the appropriate finance mechanisms are necessary for this transformation
