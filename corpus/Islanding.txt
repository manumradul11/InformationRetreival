islanding refers to the condition in which a distributed generator dg continues to power a location even though electrical grid power from the electric utility is no longer present islanding can be dangerous to utility workers who may not realize that a circuit is still powered and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices for that reason distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately stop producing power this is referred to as anti-islanding
the common example of islanding is a grid supply line that has solar panels attached to it in the case of a blackout the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as irradiance is sufficient in this case the supply line becomes an island with power surrounded by a sea of unpowered lines for this reason solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have some sort of automatic anti-islanding circuitry in them
in intentional islanding the generator disconnects from the grid and forces the distributed generator to power the local circuit this is often used as a power backup system for buildings that normally sell their excess power to the grid


electrical inverters are devices that convert direct current dc to alternating current ac grid-interactive inverters have the additional requirement that they produce ac power that matches the existing power presented on the grid in particular a grid-interactive inverter must match the voltage frequency and phase of the power line it connects to there are numerous technical requirements to the accuracy of this tracking
consider the case of a house with an array of solar panels on the roof inverters attached to the panels convert the varying dc current provided by the panels into ac power that matches the grid supply if the grid is disconnected the voltage on the grid line might be expected to drop to zero a clear indication of a service interruption however consider the case when the house's load exactly matches the output of the panels at the instant of the grid interruption in this case the panels can continue supplying power which is used up by the house's load in this case there is no obvious indication that an interruption has occurred
normally even when the load and production are exactly matched the so-called balanced condition the failure of the grid will result in several additional transient signals being generated for instance there will almost always be a brief decrease in line voltage which will signal a potential fault condition however such events can also be caused by normal operation like the starting of a large electric motor
methods that detect islanding without a large number of false positives is the subject of considerable research each method has some threshold that needs to be crossed before a condition is considered to be a signal of grid interruption which leads to a non-detection zone ndz the range of conditions where a real grid failure will be filtered out
given the activity in the field and the large variety of methods that have been developed to detect islanding it is important to consider whether or not the problem actually demands the amount of effort being expended generally speaking the reasons for anti-islanding are given as in no particular order
the first issue has been widely dismissed by many in the power industry line workers are already constantly exposed to unexpectedly live wires in the course of normal events ie is a house blacked out because it has no power or because they pulled the main breaker inside? normal operating procedures under hot-line rules or dead-line rules require line workers to test for power as a matter of course and it has been calculated that active islands would add a negligible risk however other emergency workers may not have time to do a line check and these issues have been extensively explored using risk-analysis tools a uk-based study concluded that the risk of electric shock associated with islanding of pv systems under worst-case pv penetration scenarios to both network operators and customers is typically <10−9 per year
the second possibility is also considered extremely remote in addition to thresholds that are designed to operate quickly islanding detection systems also have absolute thresholds that will trip long before conditions are reached that could cause end-user equipment damage it is generally the last two issues that cause the most concern among utilities reclosers are commonly used to divide up the grid into smaller sections that will automatically and quickly re-energize the branch as soon as the fault condition a tree branch on lines for instance clears there is some concern that the reclosers may not re-energize in the case of an island or that the rapid cycling they cause might interfere with the ability of the dg system to match the grid again after the fault clears
if an islanding issue does exist it appears to be limited to certain types of generators a 2004 canadian report concluded that synchronous generators installations like microhydro were the main concern these systems may have considerable mechanical inertia that will provide a useful signal for inverter based systems the report largely dismissed the problem anti-islanding technology for inverter based dg systems is much better developed and published risk assessments suggest that the current technology and standards provide adequate protection while penetration of dg into the distribution system remains relatively low the report also noted that views on the importance of this issue tend to be very polarized with utilities generally considering the possibility of occurrence and its impacts while those supporting dg systems generally use a risk based approach and the very low probabilities of an island forming
an example of such an approach one that strengthens the case that islanding is largely a non-issue is a major real-world islanding experiment that was carried out in the netherlands in 1999 although based on then-current anti-islanding system typically the most basic voltage jump detection methods the testing clearly demonstrated that islands could not last longer than 60 seconds moreover the theoretical predictions were true the chance of a balance condition existing were on the order of 10−6 a year and that the chance that the grid would disconnect at that point in time was even less as an island can only form when both conditions are true they concluded that the probability of encountering an islanding is virtually zero
nevertheless utility companies have continued to use islanding as a reason to delay or refuse the implementation of distributed generation systems in ontario ontario hydro recently introduced interconnection guidelines that refused connection if the total distributed generation capacity on a branch was 7% of the maximum yearly peak power at the same time california sets a limit of 15% only for review allowing connections up to 30% and is actively considering moving the review-only limit to 50%
the issue can be hotly political in ontario a number of potential customers taking advantage of a new feed-in tariff program were refused connection only after building their systems this was a problem particularly in rural areas where numerous farmers were able to set up small 10 kwp systems under the capacity exempt microfit program only to find that hydro one had implemented a new capacity regulation after the fact in many cases after the systems had been installed
detecting an islanding condition is the subject of considerable research in general these can be classified into passive methods which look for transient events on the grid and active methods which probe the grid by sending signals of some sort from the inverter or the grid distribution point there are also methods that the utility can use to detect the conditions that would cause the inverter-based methods to fail and deliberately upset those conditions in order to make the inverters switch off a sandia labs report covers many of these methodologies both in-use and future developments these methods are summarized below
passive methods include any system that attempts to detect transient changes on the grid and use that information as the basis as a probabilistic determination of whether or not the grid has failed or some other condition has resulted in a temporary change
according to ohm's law the voltage in an electrical circuit is a function of electric current the supply of electrons and the applied load resistance in the case of a grid interruption the current being supplied by the local source is unlikely to match the load so perfectly as to be able to maintain a constant voltage a system that periodically samples voltage and looks for sudden changes can be used to detect a fault condition
underover voltage detection is normally trivial to implement in grid-interactive inverters because the basic function of the inverter is to match the grid conditions including voltage that means that all grid-interactive inverters by necessity have the circuitry needed to detect the changes all that is needed is an algorithm to detect sudden changes however sudden changes in voltage are a common occurrence on the grid as loads are attached and removed so a threshold must be used to avoid false disconnections
the range of conditions that result in non-detection with this method may be large and these systems are generally used along with other detection systems
the frequency of the power being delivered to the grid is a function of the supply one that the inverters carefully match when the grid source is lost the frequency of the power would fall to the natural resonant frequency of the circuits in the island looking for changes in this frequency like voltage is easy to implement using already required functionality and for this reason almost all inverters also look for fault conditions using this method as well
unlike changes in voltage it is generally considered highly unlikely that a random circuit would naturally have a natural frequency the same as the grid power however many devices deliberately synchronize to the grid frequency like televisions motors in particular may be able to provide a signal that is within the ndz for some time as they wind down the combination of voltage and frequency shifts still results in a ndz that is not considered adequate by all
in order to decrease the time in which an island is detected rate of change of frequency has been adopted as a detection method the rate of change of frequency is given by the following expression

where is the system frequency is the time is the power imbalance  is the system capacity and is the system inertia
should the rate of change of frequency or rocof value be greater than a certain value the embedded generation will be disconnected from the network
loads generally have power factors that are not perfect meaning that they do not accept the voltage from the grid perfectly but impede it slightly grid-tie inverters by definition have power factors of 1 this can lead to changes in phase when the grid fails which can be used to detect islanding
inverters generally track the phase of the grid signal using a phase locked loop pll of some sort the pll stays in sync with the grid signal by tracking when the signal crosses zero volts between those events the system is essentially drawing a sine-shaped output varying the current output to the circuit to produce the proper voltage waveform when the grid disconnects the power factor suddenly changes from the grid's 1 to the load's ~1 as the circuit is still providing a current that would produce a smooth voltage output given the known loads this condition will result in a sudden change in voltage by the time the waveform is completed and returns to zero the signal will be out of phase
the main advantage to this approach is that the shift in phase will occur even if the load exactly matches the supply in terms of ohm's law - the ndz is based on power factors of the island which are very rarely 1 the downside is that many common events like motors starting also cause phase jumps as new impedances are added to the circuit this forces the system to use relatively large thresholds reducing its effectiveness
even with noisy sources like motors the total harmonic distortion thd of a grid-connected circuit is generally unmeasurable due to the essentially infinite capacity of the grid that filters these events out inverters on the other hand generally have much larger distortions as much as 5% thd this is a function of their construction some thd is a natural side-effect of the switched-mode power supply circuits most inverters are based on
thus when the grid disconnects the thd of the local circuit will naturally increase to that of the inverters themselves this provides a very secure method of detecting islanding because there are generally no other sources of thd that would match that of the inverter additionally interactions within the inverters themselves notably the transformers have non-linear effects that produce unique 2nd and 3rd harmonics that are easily measurable
the drawback of this approach is that some loads may filter out the distortion in the same way that the inverter attempts to if this filtering effect is strong enough it may reduce the thd below the threshold needed to trigger detection systems without a transformer on the inside of the disconnect point will make detection more difficult however the largest problem is that modern inverters attempt to lower the thd as much as possible in some cases to unmeasurable limits
active methods generally attempt to detect a grid failure by injecting small signals into the line and then detecting whether or not the signal changes
this method is an active islanding detection method which can be used by three-phase electronically coupled distributed generation dg units the method is based on injecting a negative-sequence current through the voltage-sourced converter vsc controller and detecting and quantifying the corresponding negative-sequence voltage at the point of common coupling pcc of the vsc by means of a unified three-phase signal processor utsp the utsp system is an enhanced phase-locked loop pll which provides high degree of immunity to noise and thus enable islanding detection based on injecting a small negative-sequence current the negative-sequence current is injected by a negative-sequence controller which is adopted as the complementary of the conventional vsc current controller the negative-sequence current injection method • detects an islanding event within 60 ms 3.5 cycles under ul1741 test conditions • requires 2% to 3% negative-sequence current injection for islanding detection • can correctly detect an islanding event for the grid short circuit ratio of 2 or higher • is insensitive to variations of the load parameters of ul1741 test system for more details about this method the reader is referred to negative-sequence current injection for fast islanding detection of a distributed resource unit houshang karimi amirnaser yazdani and reza iravani ieee transactions on power electronics vol 23 no 1 january 2008
impedance measurement attempts to measure the overall impedance of the circuit being fed by the inverter it does this by slightly forcing the current amplitude through the ac cycle presenting too much current at a given time normally this would have no effect on the measured voltage as the grid is an effectively infinitely stiff voltage source in the event of a disconnection even the small forcing would result in a noticeable change in voltage allowing detection of the island
the main advantage of this method is that it has a vanishingly small ndz for any given single inverter however the inverse is also the main weakness of this method in the case of multiple inverters each one would be forcing a slightly different signal into the line hiding the effects on any one inverter it is possible to address this problem by communication between the inverters to ensure they all force on the same schedule but in a non-homogeneous install multiple installations on a single branch this becomes difficult or impossible in practice additionally the method only works if the grid is effectively infinite and in practice many real-world grid connections do not sufficiently meet this criterion
although the methodology is similar to impedance measurement this method also known as harmonic amplitude jump is actually closer to harmonics detection in this case the inverter deliberately introduces harmonics at a given frequency and as in the case of impedance measurement expects the signal from the grid to overwhelm it until the grid fails like harmonics detection the signal may be filtered out by real-world circuits
this is one of the newest methods of islanding detection and in theory one of the best it is based on forcing the phase of the inverter's output to be slightly mis-aligned with the grid with the expectation that the grid will overwhelm this signal the system relies on the actions of a finely tuned phase-locked loop to become unstable when the grid signal is missing in this case the pll attempts to adjust the signal back to itself which is tuned to continue to drift in the case of grid failure the system will quickly drift away from the design frequency eventually causing the inverter to shut down
the major advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented using circuitry that is already present in the inverter the main disadvantage is that it requires the inverter to always be slightly out of time with the grid a lowered power factor generally speaking the system has a vanishingly small ndz and will quickly disconnect but it is known that there are some loads that will react to offset the detection
frequency bias forces a slightly off-frequency signal into the grid but fixes this at the end of every cycle by jumping back into phase when the voltage passes zero this creates a signal similar to slip mode but the power factor remains closer to that of the grid's and resets itself every cycle moreover the signal is less likely to be filtered out by known loads the main disadvantage is that every inverter would have to agree to shift the signal back to zero at the same point on the cycle say as the voltage crosses back to zero otherwise different inverters will force the signal in different directions and filter it out
there are numerous possible variations to this basic scheme the frequency jump version also known as the zebra method inserts forcing only on a specific number of cycles in a set pattern this dramatically reduces the chance that external circuits may filter the signal out this advantage disappears with multiple inverters unless some way of synchronizing the patterns is used
the utility also has a variety of methods available to it to force systems offline in the event of a failure
most small generator connections require a mechanical disconnect switch so at a minimum the utility could send a repairman to pull them all for very large sources one might simply install a dedicated telephone hotline that can be used to have an operator manually shut down the generator in either case the reaction time is likely to be on the order of minutes or hours
manual disconnection could be automated through the use of signals sent though the grid or on secondary means for instance power line carrier communications could be installed in all inverters periodically checking for signals from the utility and disconnecting either on command or if the signal disappears for a fixed time such a system would be highly reliable but expensive to implement
as the utility can be reasonably assured that they will always have a method for discovering a fault whether that be automated or simply looking at the recloser it is possible for the utility to use this information and transmit it down the line this can be used to force the tripping of properly equipped dg systems by deliberately opening a series of recloser in the grid to force the dg system to be isolated in a way that forces it out of the ndz this method can be guaranteed to work but requires the grid to be equipped with automated recloser systems and external communications systems that guarantee the signal will make it through to the reclosers
a related concept is to deliberately force a section of the grid into a condition that will guarantee the dg systems will disconnect this is similar to the transfer-trip method but uses active systems at the head-end of the utility as opposed to relying on the topology of the network
a simple example is a large bank of capacitors that are added to a branch left charged up and normally disconnected by a switch in the event of a failure the capacitors are switched into the branch by the utility after a short delay this can be easily accomplished through automatic means at the point of distribution the capacitors can only supply current for a brief period ensuring that the start or end of the pulse they deliver will cause enough of a change to trip the inverters
there appears to be no ndz for this method of anti-islanding its main disadvantage is cost the capacitor bank has to be large enough to cause changes in voltage that will be detected and this is a function of the amount of load on the branch in theory very large banks would be needed an expense the utility is unlikely to look on favourably
anti-islanding protection can be improved through the use of the supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems already widely used in the utility market for instance an alarm could sound if the scada system detects voltage on a line where a failure is known to be in progress this does not affect the anti-islanding systems but may allow any of the systems noted above to be quickly implemented
