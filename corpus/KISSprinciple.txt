kiss is an acronym for keep it simple stupid as a design principle noted by the us navy in 1960 the kiss principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided the phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer kelly johnson 1910–1990 the term kiss principle was in popular use by 1970 variations on the phrase include keep it simple silly keep it short and simple keep it simple and straightforward and keep it small and simple


the acronym was reportedly coined by kelly johnson lead engineer at the lockheed skunk works creators of the lockheed u-2 and sr-71 blackbird spy planes among many others
while popular usage has transcribed it for decades as keep it simple stupid johnson transcribed it as keep it simple stupid no comma and this reading is still used by many authors there was no implicit meaning that an engineer was stupid just the opposite
the principle is best exemplified by the story of johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools hence the stupid refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them
the acronym has been used by many in the united states air force and the field of software development
the principle most likely finds its origins in similar concepts such as occam's razor leonardo da vinci's simplicity is the ultimate sophistication mies van der rohe's less is more bjarne stroustrup's make simple tasks simple or antoine de saint exupéry's it seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away colin chapman the founder of lotus cars urged his designers to simplify then add lightness heath robinson machines and rube goldberg's machines intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems are humorous examples of non-kiss solutions
an alternative view – make everything as simple as possible but not simpler – is attributed to albert einstein although this may be an editor's paraphrase of a lecture he gave
a variant used in marketing is keep it simple and straightforward 
master animator richard williams explains the kiss principle in his book the animator's survival kit and disney's nine old men write about it in disney animation the illusion of life a considerable work of the genre the problem faced is that inexperienced animators may over-animate in their works that is a character may move too much and do too much williams urges animators to kiss
