the kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to utilize directed towards communication the scale has three designated categories called type i ii and iii a type i civilization is able to utilize and store energy available from its neighboring star which reaches their planet type ii is able to harness the energy of the entire star the most popular hypothetic concept being the dyson sphere—a device which would encompass the entire star and transfer its energy to the planet and type iii civilization are in control of energy on the scale of their entire host galaxy the scale is hypothetical and regards energy consumption on a cosmic scale it was first proposed in 1964 by the soviet astronomer nikolai kardashev various extensions of the scale have been proposed since from a wider range of power levels types 0 iv and v to the use of metrics other than pure power


in 1964 kardashev defined three levels of civilizations based on the order of magnitude of power available to them
type i
type ii
type iii
michio kaku suggested that humans may attain type i status in 100–200 years type ii status in a few thousand years and type iii status in 100000 to a million years
carl sagan suggested defining intermediate values not considered in kardashev's original scale by interpolating and extrapolating the values given above for types i 1016 w ii 1026 w and iii 1036 w which would produce the formula
where value k is a civilization's kardashev rating and p is the power it uses in watts using this extrapolation a type 0 civilization not defined by kardashev would control about 1 mw of power and humanity's civilization type as of 1973 was about 0.7 apparently using 10 terawatt tw as the value for 1970s humanity
in 2012 total world energy consumption was 553 exajoules 7020553000000000000♠553×1018 j=153611 twh equivalent to an average power consumption of 17.54 tw or 0.724 on sagan's kardashev scale
in 2015 a study of galactic mid-infrared emissions came to the conclusion that kardashev type-iii civilizations are either very rare or do not exist in the local universe on october 14 2015 the realization of a strange pattern of light surrounding star kic 8462852 has raised speculation that a dyson sphere type ii civilization may have been discovered
there are many historical examples of human civilization undergoing large-scale transitions such as the industrial revolution the transition between kardashev scale levels could potentially represent similarly dramatic periods of social upheaval since they entail surpassing the hard limits of the resources available in a civilization's existing territory a common speculation suggests that the transition from type 0 to type i might carry a strong risk of self-destruction since in some scenarios there would no longer be room for further expansion on the civilization's home planet as in a malthusian catastrophe excessive use of energy without adequate disposal of heat for example could plausibly make the planet of a civilization approaching type i unsuitable to the biology of the dominant life-forms and their food sources if earth is an example then sea temperatures in excess of 35 c would jeopardize marine life and make the cooling of mammals to temperatures suitable for their metabolism difficult if not impossible of course these theoretical speculations may not become problems in reality thanks to evolution or the application of future engineering and technology also by the time a civilization reaches type i it may have colonized other planets or created o'neill-type colonies so that waste heat could be distributed throughout the solar system
many extensions and modifications to the kardashev scale have been proposed
according to this scale human civilization is between iii- and iv-minus
it has been argued that because we cannot understand advanced civilizations we cannot predict their behavior thus the kardashev scale may not be relevant or useful for classifying extraterrestrial civilizations this central argument is found in the book evolving the alien the science of extraterrestrial life
it has also been argued from the standpoint of efficiency that the kardashev scale requires further development should a civilization be able to harness power of whatever arbitrarily large scale it does not mean that it has likewise developed a commensurate ability to use that energy with efficiency
posit a star system wherein a star-shrouding cloud of pebbles plays host to an photosynthetic algae or bacterium that almost completely surrounds a star such a 'civilization' may have the means to acquire and have access to far more energy than that is available on earth either proportionately or in absolute terms none the less we would not call such a civilization 'technologically more advanced' in virtue of its resource advantage alone even if it were to completely absorb all the energy from said star
