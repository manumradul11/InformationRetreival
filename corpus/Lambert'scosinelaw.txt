in optics lambert's cosine law says that the radiant intensity or luminous intensity observed from an ideal diffusely reflecting surface or ideal diffuse radiator is directly proportional to the cosine of the angle θ between the direction of the incident light and the surface normal the law is also known as the cosine emission law or lambert's emission law it is named after johann heinrich lambert from his photometria published in 1760
a surface which obeys lambert's law is said to be lambertian and exhibits lambertian reflectance such a surface has the same radiance when viewed from any angle this means for example that to the human eye it has the same apparent brightness or luminance it has the same radiance because although the emitted power from a given area element is reduced by the cosine of the emission angle the apparent size solid angle of the observed area as seen by a viewer is decreased by a corresponding amount therefore its radiance power per unit solid angle per unit projected source area is the same


when an area element is radiating as a result of being illuminated by an external source the irradiance energy or photonstimearea landing on that area element will be proportional to the cosine of the angle between the illuminating source and the normal a lambertian scatterer will then scatter this light according to the same cosine law as a lambertian emitter this means that although the radiance of the surface depends on the angle from the normal to the illuminating source it will not depend on the angle from the normal to the observer for example if the moon were a lambertian scatterer one would expect to see its scattered brightness appreciably diminish towards the terminator due to the increased angle at which sunlight hit the surface the fact that it does not diminish illustrates that the moon is not a lambertian scatterer and in fact tends to scatter more light into the oblique angles than would a lambertian scatterer
the emission of a lambertian radiator does not depend upon the amount of incident radiation but rather from radiation originating in the emitting body itself for example if the sun were a lambertian radiator one would expect to see a constant brightness across the entire solar disc the fact that the sun exhibits limb darkening in the visible region illustrates that it is not a lambertian radiator a black body is an example of a lambertian radiator
the situation for a lambertian surface emitting or scattering is illustrated in figures 1 and 2 for conceptual clarity we will think in terms of photons rather than energy or luminous energy the wedges in the circle each represent an equal angle dω and for a lambertian surface the number of photons per second emitted into each wedge is proportional to the area of the wedge
it can be seen that the length of each wedge is the product of the diameter of the circle and cosθ it can also be seen that the maximum rate of photon emission per unit solid angle is along the normal and diminishes to zero for θ = 90° in mathematical terms the radiance along the normal is i photonss·cm2·sr and the number of photons per second emitted into the vertical wedge is i dω da the number of photons per second emitted into the wedge at angle θ is i cosθ dω da
figure 2 represents what an observer sees the observer directly above the area element will be seeing the scene through an aperture of area da0 and the area element da will subtend a solid angle of dω0 we can assume without loss of generality that the aperture happens to subtend solid angle dω when viewed from the emitting area element this normal observer will then be recording i dω da photons per second and so will be measuring a radiance of
the observer at angle θ to the normal will be seeing the scene through the same aperture of area da0 and the area element da will subtend a solid angle of dω0 cosθ this observer will be recording i cosθ dω da photons per second and so will be measuring a radiance of
which is the same as the normal observer
in general the luminous intensity of a point on a surface varies by direction for a lambertian surface that distribution is defined by the cosine law with peak luminous intensity in the normal direction thus when the lambertian assumption holds we can calculate the total luminous flux  from the peak luminous intensity  by integrating the cosine law
and so
where is the determinant of the jacobian matrix for the unit sphere and realizing that is luminous flux per steradian similarly the peak intensity will be of the total radiated luminous flux for lambertian surfaces the same factor of relates luminance to luminous emittance radiant intensity to radiant flux and radiance to radiant emittancecitation needed radians and steradians are of course dimensionless and so rad and sr are included only for clarity
example a surface with a luminance of say 100 cdm2 = 100 nits typical pc monitor will if it is a perfect lambert emitter have a luminous emittance of 314 lmm2 if its area is 0.1 m2 ~19 monitor then the total light emitted or luminous flux would thus be 31.4 lm
lambert's cosine law in its reversed form lambertian reflection implies that the apparent brightness of a lambertian surface is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the direction of the incident light
this phenomenon is among others used when creating mouldings with the effect of creating light- and dark-shaded stripes on a structure or object without having to change the material or apply pigment the contrast of dark and light areas gives definition to the object mouldings are strips of material with various cross-sections used to cover transitions between surfaces or for decoration
