other routes of training are through informal apprenticeships with practicing landscape designers landscape architects landscape contractors gardeners nurseries and garden centers and docent programs at botanical and public gardens since the landscape designer title does not have college degree or licensing requirements to be used there is a very wide range of sophistication aesthetic talent technical expertise and specialty strengths to be responsibly matched with specific client and project requirementscitation needed
many landscape designers have an interest and involvement with gardening personally or professionally some integrate this scope with their design practice informally or as licensed landscape contractors gardens are dynamic and not static after construction and planting are completed and so in some ways 'never done' involvement with landscape management and direction of ongoing garden direction evolution and care occurring depend on the professional's and client's needs and inclinations as with the other interrelated landscape disciplines there can be overlap of services offered under the titles of landscape designer or professional gardenercitation needed
