level design environment design or game mappingcitation needed is a discipline of game development involving creation of video game levelsâ€”locales stages or missions this is commonly done using a level editor a game development software designed for building levels however some games feature built-in level editing tools level design is both an artistic and technical process


in early days of video games a single programmer would create the maps and layouts for a game and a discipline or profession dedicated solely to level design did not exist
early games often featured a level system of ascending difficulty as opposed to progression of story-line
the first game genre that required significant amounts of time to design areas were text-based games such as muds often promoted users were assigned to create new paths new rooms new equipment and new actions often using the game interface itself zzt is another early game notable for its user-accessible mapping and event triggeringscripting
1983's lode runner was one of the first titles to ship with a level editor and its designer douglas smith reputedly paid neighborhood children to design levels for the game
doom 1993 and doom ii 1994 were two of the first games to attract focused game modding activity and many wad level files were made for them one of the reasons was a clear separation between the level files and game engine itself half-life quake 3 and many other games have notable mapping tools and communitiescitation needed focusing on user-generated content
in certain games such as roguelike games levels may be procedurally generated in these cases the original game programmer controls how the variations of rooms and tunnels are formed by tweaking the randomly seeded algorithms

level design for each individual level in a modern game typically starts with concept art sketches renderings and physical models once completed these concepts transform into extensive documentation environment modeling and the placing of game specific entities actors usually with the aid of a level editor
a level editor may be distributed as a complete stand-alone package at times rivaling commercial 3d modelling software there are various steps involved in laying out a map and these steps may vary dramatically across the many different game genres that exist today
general steps include
cut scenes may be triggered by events in a level but require distinctly different skills and may be created by a different person or team
the level design process may be iterated several times before achieving the desired outcome
level designers andor concept artists may also be required to provide a pre-rendered map of the level or entire game world for the player
there are many map bugs that level designers try to avoid but sometimes go unnoticed for some time
a player might get stuck in map geometry with no way to escape or to die a player might be able to find a specific spot where they do not have to move to gain experience because monsters are constantly spawned but can be easily and immediately killedcitation needed in multiplayer maps a player may be able to reach areas of the map designed to be inaccessible for example reaching an advantageous rooftop position and camping other players in the worst case a player might be able to fall out-of-bounds of a map where other players cannot reach themcitation needed invisible walls are cited to be level design bugs and might be left-over geometry from an earlier version of the level or an object's improperly aligned collision box
in some cases specific mapping tools can be designed to automatically detect problems such as falling outside a level and reaching stuck areas careful level designers run these tools as the last step before releasing a new version of a level in most cases the best way to improve a map is by playtesting it with experienced players and allowing them to try to exploit any problems
a level designer is a game designer who creates environments and scenarios using a level editor and other tools level designers will usually work on a level from pre-production to completion working with both incomplete and complete versions of the game game programmers usually produce level editors and design tools for the designers to use this eliminates the need for designers to access or modify game code as opposed to the level editing tools sometimes available to the community level designers often work with placeholders and prototypes aiming for level consistency and clear layout before required artwork is produced by game artists many level designers have skills as both a visual artist and game designers although in recent years the responsibility for visual structural and gameplay related tasks has been increasingly divided among several specialists
a number of individuals have made significant contributions to the field of pc first person shooter levels these level designers include john romero responsible for a great deal of the level design for doom and richard levelord gray creator of a number of levels for duke nukem 3d and sincitation needed
level design is necessary for two primary purposes - providing players with a goal and providing players with enjoyable play experience good level design strives to produce quality gameplay provide an immersive experience and sometimes especially in story-based games to advance the storyline skilled use of textures and audio is necessary to produce immersive player experiencecitation needed
maps' design can significantly impact the gameplay for example the gameplay may be shifted towards a platformer by careful placement of platforms or a puzzle game by extensive use of buttons keys and doors some fps maps may be designed to prevent sniping by not including any long hallways while other maps may allow for a mix of sniping and closer combat
gimmick maps are sometimes created to explore selected features of gameplay such as sniping or fist fighting while they are briefly useful to level designers and interesting to experienced players they are usually not included in final list of levels of the game because of their limited replay value
levels are generally constructed with flow control in mind that is directing the player towards the goal of the level and preventing confusion and idling this can be accomplished by various means
often the level layouts features power-ups and items aligned in path and combinations that collecting them inevitably progresses the game and advances the story-line this is one of the basic player direction technique and is most often seen in platformers
lighting and illumination as well as distinctly coloured objects are often used to unambiguously steer the player towards the correct path similarly clearly marked choke-points can be introduced
another method is strategic placement of obstacles and aesthetic environment props that direct the player's attention to clear paths instead this is often used in closed stuffed environments
levels may be designed to force the players to explore the map and advance most rts maps give each player a starting base but will have resource distribution and terrain features designed to draw players out of their base and engage each other teamplay maps can provide noticeable advantages to one team over another when designed poorly
level designers sometimes create hidden rooms and areas that usually require more effort for the player to reach or to notice these usually give some additional rewards such as ammo or powerups casual players usually do not discover these but these areas are interesting enough to be discovered and documented by dedicated gamers sometimes they serve as easter eggs containing messages such as the level designers' names or pictures or political or humorous messages one of the first games with a 3d engine to feature hidden features was wolfenstein 3d where certain walls could be pushed to reveal hidden passages for example quake has many secret areas that reward the player with ammo weapons quad damage powerups and in one hard-to-reach secret area dopefish makes an appearance in fact the hardest difficulty level titled nightmare is only reachable through a secret portal in the fourth dimension's entrance hall
sometimes a whole level may be designed as a secret level
a wide variety of tools may be used by someone designing a level although it is faster to design models and textures with general purpose multimedia creation tools games usually require the data to be in a unique format suited for that game's engine for this specific compilers and converters of models textures and audio data may be required to lay out a level
some level editors for windows games include bethesda softworks's construction set valve's hammer editor epic's unrealed and udk leadwerks 3d world studio bioware's aurora toolset id software's q3radiant unity 3d and grome outdoor editor multi engine multi game editors include id software's gtkradiant based on q3radiant and the open source quark some games may have built-in level editors like battlezone 2 cube 2 sauerbraten and doom 3 an example of a console game with a level editor is timesplitters developed by free radical design sometimes professional 3d editing software such as 3d studio max blender autocad lightwave maya softimage xsi or grome is used usually customized with a special plugin developed for the specific gamecitation needed
