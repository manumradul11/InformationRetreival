engineering is the discipline art and profession that applies scientific theory to design develop and analyze technological solutions in the contemporary era it is generally considered to consist of the major basic branches of chemical engineering civil engineering electrical engineering and mechanical engineering there are numerous other engineering subdisciplines and interdisciplinary subjects that are derived from concentrations combinations or extensions of the major engineering branches


software engineering is the study and an application of engineering to the design development implementation and maintenance of software in a systematic method
chemical engineering is the application of chemical physical and biological sciences to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms
civil engineering comprises the design construction and maintenance of the physical and natural built environments
with the process of mineral extraction some amount of waste and uneconomic material are generated which are the primary source of pollution in the vicinity of mines mining activities by their nature cause a disturbance of the natural environment in and around which the minerals are located mining engineers must therefore be concerned not only with the production and processing of mineral commodities but also with the mitigation of damage to the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the mining area
electrical engineering comprises the study and application of electricity electronics and electromagnetism
mechanical engineering comprises the design analysis and usage of heat and mechanical power for the operation of machines and mechanical systems
field of engineering that designs construct and maintains different types of power plants serves as the prime mover to produce electricity
systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering projects over their life cycles issues such as reliability logistics and coordination of different teams requirements management evaluation measurements and other disciplines become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects systems engineering deals with work-processes optimization methods and risk management tools it overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering industrial engineering organizational studies and project management systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered and integrated into a whole
