this page lists the top 25 offshore wind farms that are currently operational rated by nameplate capacity it also lists the three largest offshore wind farms currently under construction the 10 largest proposed offshore wind farms and offshore wind farms with notability other than size
as of august 2013 the london array in the united kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 630 mw this is followed by gwynt y môr 576 mw also in the uk the global tech i wind farm 400 mw in germany is the largest project currently under construction
the biggest producer of wind energy is the greater gabbard wind farm in 2012 it produced 1195 gigawatt-hours gwh the second largest producer is horns rev 2 with 956 gwh produced in 2012 in terms of total production since introduction horns rev 1 remains the largest with 5877 gwh produced since the park opened nysted 1 also in denmark is the second largest wind farm in the world in terms of total energy produced nysted 1 has produced 5097 gwh since its start third is horns rev 2 with 2959 gwh produced


this is a list of the top 25 offshore wind farms that are currently operational rated by nameplate capacity in the case of a tied bottom place in the table the wind farm with the earliest commissioning date is used
this is a list of the five largest offshore wind farms currently under construction
this is a list of the 3 largest offshore wind farms by actual energy production since commissioning
the following table lists largest offshore wind farm areas by nameplate capacity that are only at a proposal stage and have achieved at least some of the formal consents required before construction can begin
