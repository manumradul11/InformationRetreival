the following is a list of photovoltaic power stations that are larger than 100 megawatts mw in current net capacity most are individual photovoltaic power stations but some are groups of co-located plants owned by different independent power producers and with separate transformer connections to the grid wiki-solar reports total global capacity of utility-scale photovoltaic plants to be some 60 gwac at the end of 2015
the size of photovoltaic power stations has increased progressively over the last decade with frequent new capacity records the 97 mw sarnia photovoltaic power plant went online in 2010 huanghe hydropower golmud solar park reached 200 mw in 2012 in august 2012 agua caliente solar project arizona 290 mw reached 247 mw only to be passed by three larger plants in 2013 as of november 2014 topaz solar farm was the largest pv solar plant in the world at 550 mwac in central coast area and a second 550-mw plant the desert sunlight solar farm is located in the far eastern desert region of riverside county california these two plants were superseded by a new world's largest facility in june 2015 when the 579 mwac solar star project went online in the antelope valley region of los angeles county california additional even larger solar plants including some over 1000 mw have been proposed around the world
