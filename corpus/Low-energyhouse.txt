a low-energy house is any type of house that from design technologies and building products uses less energy from any source than a traditional or average contemporary house in the practice of sustainable design sustainable architecture low-energy building energy-efficient landscaping low-energy houses often use active solar and passive solar building design techniques and components to reduce their energy expenditure


the meaning of the term 'low-energy house' has changed over time but in europe it generally refers to a house that uses around half of the german or swiss low-energy standards referred to below for space heating typically in the range from 30 kwhm²a to 20 kwhm²a 9500 btuft²yr to 6300 btuft²yr below this the term 'ultra-low-energy building' is often used
the term can also refer to any dwelling whose energy use is below the standards demanded by current building codes because national standards vary considerably around the world 'low-energy' developments in one country may not meet 'normal practice' in another
in some countries the term relates to a specific building standard in particular these seek to limit the energy used for space heating since in many climate zones it represents the largest energy use other energy use may also be regulated the history of passive solar building design gives an international look at one form of low-energy building development and standards
in germany a low-energy house niedrigenergiehaus has a limit equivalent to 7 litres of heating oil for each square metre of room for space heating annually 50 kwhm²a or 15850 btuft²yr in switzerland the term is used in connection with the minergie standard 42 kwhm²a or 13300 btuft²yr or the minergie-p equivalent to the passivhaus
in comparison the german passivhaus ultra-low-energy standard currently undergoing adoption in some other european countries has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kwhm²a or 4755 btuft²yr
a sub-10 passive house is under construction in ireland that has an independently evaluated phpp passive house rating of 9.5 kwm2year its form of construction also tackles the issue of embodied energy which can significantly distort the lifecycle co2 emissions associated with even low energy use houses
in the united states the energy star program is the largest program defining low-energy homes and consumer products homes earning energy star certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the international residential code although homes typically achieve 20%–30% savings
in addition the us department of energy launched a program in 2008 with the goal of spreading zero-energy housing over the us currently participating builders commit to constructing new homes that achieve 30% savings on a home energy rating scale
beyond ultra-low-energy buildings are those that use on average over the course of a year no imported energy - zero-energy buildings – or even those that generate a surplus - energy-plus houses – both of which have been and are being successfully built
this can be achieved by a mixture of energy conservation technologies and the use of renewable energy sources however in the absence of recognized standards the mix between these – and consequently the energy-use profile and environmental impact of the building – can vary significantly
at one end of the spectrum are buildings with an ultra-low space heating requirement that therefore require low levels of imported energy even in winter approaching the concept of an autonomous building
at the opposite end of the spectrum are buildings where few attempts are made to reduce the space heating requirement and which therefore use high levels of imported energy in winter while this can be balanced by high levels of renewable energy generation throughout the year it imposes greater demands on the traditional national energy infrastructure during the peak winter season
low-energy buildings typically use high levels of insulation energy efficient windows low levels of air infiltration and heat recovery ventilation to lower heating and cooling energy they may also use passive solar building design techniques or active solar technologies these homes may use hot water heat recycling technologies to recover heat from showers and dishwashers lighting and miscellaneous energy use is allieviated with fluorescent lighting and efficient appliances weatherization provides more information on increasing building energy efficiency
passive houses are required to achieve a whole building air change rate of no more than 0.6 achr  footnote 1 under forced pressurisation and depressurisation testing at 50pa minimum on site blower door testing by certified testers is used to prove compliance
a significant feature of ultra-low-energy buildings is the increasing importance of heat loss through linear thermal bridging within the construction failure to eliminate thermal pathways from warm to cold surfaces bridges creates the conditions for interstitial condensation forming deep within the construction and lead to potentially serious issues of mould growth and rot with near zero filtration losses through the fabric of the dwelling air movement cannot be relied upon to dry out the construction and a comprehensive condensation risk analysis of every abutment detail is recommended
passive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the low-energy house in conservation and can integrate them into a neighborhood and environment following passive solar building techniques where possible buildings are compact in shape to reduce their surface area with principal windows oriented towards the equator - south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere - to maximize passive solar gain however the use of solar gain especially in temperate climate regions is secondary to minimizing the overall house energy requirements in climates and regions needing to reduce excessive summer passive solar heat gain whether from the direct or reflected sources can be done with a brise soleil trees attached pergolas with vines vertical gardens green roofs and other techniques
low-energy houses can be constructed from dense or lightweight materials but some internal thermal mass is normally incorporated to reduce summer peak temperatures maintain stable winter temperatures and prevent possible overheating in spring or autumn before the higher sun angle shades mid-day wall exposure and window penetration exterior wall color when the surface allows choice for reflection or absorption insolation qualities depends on the predominant year-round ambient outdoor temperature the use of deciduous trees and wall trellised or self attaching vines can assist in climates not at the temperature extremes
to minimize the total primary energy consumption the many passive and active daylighting techniques are the first daytime solution to employ for low light level days non-daylighted spaces and nighttime the use of creative-sustainable lighting design using low-energy sources such as 'standard voltage' compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state lighting with light-emitting diode-led lamps organic light-emitting diodes and pled - polymer light-emitting diodes and 'low voltage' electrical filament-incandescent light bulbs and compact metal halide xenon and halogen lamps can be used
solar powered exterior circulation security and landscape lighting - with photovoltaic cells on each fixture or connecting to a central solar panel system are available for gardens and outdoor needs low voltage systems can be used for more controlled or independent illumination while still using less electricity than conventional fixtures and lamps timers motion detection and natural light operation sensors reduce energy consumption and light pollution even further for a low-energy house setting
appliance consumer products meeting independent energy efficiency testing and receiving ecolabel certification marks for reduced electrical-'natural-gas' consumption and product manufacturing carbon emission labels are preferred for use in low-energy houses the ecolabel certification marks of energy star and ekoenergy are examples
