the mahoney tables are a set of reference tables used in architecture used as a guide to climate-appropriate design they are named after architect carl mahoney who worked on them together with john martin evans and otto k√∂nigsberger they were first published in 1971 by the united nations department of economic and social affairs
the concept developed by mahoney 1968 in nigeria provided the basis of the

the tables use readily available climate data and simple calculations to give design guidelines in a manner similar to a spreadsheet as opposed to detailed thermal analysis or simulation there are six tables four are used for entering climatic data for comparison with the requirements for thermal comfort and two for reading off appropriate design criteria a rough outline of the table usage is
