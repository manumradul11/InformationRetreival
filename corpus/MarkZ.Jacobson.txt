mark zachary jacobson born 1965 is professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and director of its atmosphere and energy program jacobson develops computer models about the effects of different energy technologies and their emissions on air pollution and climate he has done influential research on the role of aerosols and black carbon on the climate and is regarded as a leading aerosol climate modeler
according to jacobson a speedy transition to clean renewable energy is required to reduce the potential acceleration of global warming including the disappearance of the arctic sea ice this change will also eliminate 2.5-3 million deaths worldwide each year related to air pollution and reduce disruption associated with fossil fuel shortages


using computer modeling he developed over 20 years jacobson has found that carbonaceous fuel soot emissions which lead to respiratory illness heart disease and asthma have resulted in 1.5 million premature deaths each year mostly in the developing world where wood and animal dung are used for cooking jacobson has also said that soot from diesel engines coal-fired power plants and burning wood is a bigger cause of global warming than previously thought and is the major cause of the rapid melting of the arctic's sea ice
jacobson conducted several studies about 100% renewable energy systems and renewable energy integration and concluded that wind water and solar power can be scaled up in cost-effective ways to fulfill our energy demands freeing human society from dependence on both fossil fuels and nuclear power in 2009 jacobson and mark a delucchi published a plan to power 100 percent of the planet with renewables in scientific american the article addressed several issues such as the worldwide spatial footprint of wind farms the availability of scarce materials needed for manufacture of new systems the ability to produce reliable energy on demand and the average cost per kilowatt hour a more detailed and updated technical analysis has been published as a two-part article in the journal energy policy in 2010 providing all global energy with wind water and solar power the articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for all purposes electric power transportation heatingcooling etc from wind water and sunlight wws in part i jacobson and delucchi discuss wws energy system characteristics current and future energy demand availability of wws resources numbers of wws devices and area and material requirements they estimate that 3800000 5 mw wind turbines 49000 300 mw concentrated solar plants 40000 300 mw solar pv power plants 1.7 billion 3 kw rooftop pv systems 5350 100 mw geothermal power plants and 270 new 1300 mw hydroelectric power plants will be needed such a wws infrastructure reduces world power demand by 30% and requires 0.41% and 0.59% more of the world's land for footprint and spacing respectively
in part ii jacobson and delucchi address variability economics and policy of wws energy jacobson and delucchi suggest producing all new energy with wws by 2030 and replacing the pre-existing energy by 2050 barriers to the plan are primarily social and political not technological or economic the energy cost in a wws world should be similar to today's costs
more recently jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100% renewable energy produced by wind water and sunlight for new york california and washington states by 2050 in 2015 he was the lead author of two connected studies in energy and environmental science and proceedings of the national academy of sciences that examined the feasibility of transitioning the united states to a 100% energy system powered exclusively by wind water and sunlight with also solving the grid reliability problem with high shares of intermittent sources in 2016 the editorial board of pnas selected the the grid integration study of jacobson and his co-workers as best paper in the category applied biological agricultural and environmental sciences and awarded awarded him the cozarelli prize
jacobson has also worked on carbon capture and sequestration technology concluding that it can reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants but will increase air pollutants and will extend all the other deleterious effects of coal mining transport and processing because more coal must be burned to power the capture and storage steps
jacobson states that if the united states wants to reduce global warming air pollution and energy instability it should invest only in the best energy options and that nuclear power is not one of them jacobson's analyses state that nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy when reactor construction uranium refining and transport are considered these calculations are based on a 2009 study publishes in energy and environmental science which found nuclear emissions to be in the range of 68–180.1 gkwh if opportunity cost emissions are included and are higher than results provided in some other studies on that topic for example scientists from yale university who have analyzed the total life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources have not arrived at the same nuclear power emissions conclusions as jacobson has in this respect however jacobsons results are still in the range given by the ipcc 1-220 gco2eqkwh
jacobson has mainly studied how wind water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the world's energy eliminating all fossil fuels he advocates a smart mix of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand
because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps
jacobson is also engaged in the solutions project an independent outreach effort led by jacobson actor mark ruffalo and film director josh fox which proposes a transition to a 100% renewable world
