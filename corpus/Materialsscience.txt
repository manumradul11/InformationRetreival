the interdisciplinary field of materials science also commonly known as materials science and engineering involves the discovery and design of new materials with an emphasis on solids the intellectual origins of materials science stem from the enlightenment when researchers began to use analytical thinking from chemistry physics and engineering to understand ancient phenomenological observations in metallurgy and mineralogy materials science still incorporates elements of physics chemistry and engineering as such the field was long thought ofby whom? as a sub-field of these related fields in recent yearswhen? materials science has become more widely recognized as a specific and distinct field of science and engineering many of the most pressing scientific problems humans currently face are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and as a result breakthroughs in materials science are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology
materials scientists emphasize understanding how the history of a material its processing influences its structure and thus the material's properties and performance the understanding of processing-structure-properties relationships is called the § materials paradigm this paradigm is used to advance understanding in a variety of research areas including nanotechnology biomaterials and metallurgy materials science is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis - investigating materials products structures or components which fail or which do not operate or function as intended causing personal injury or damage to property such investigations are key to understanding for example the causes of various aviation accidents


the material of choice of a given era is often a defining point phrases such as stone age bronze age iron age and steel age are great examples originally deriving from the manufacture of ceramics and its putative derivative metallurgy materials science is one of the oldest forms of engineering and applied science modern materials science evolved directly from metallurgy which itself evolved from mining and likely ceramics and the use of fire a major breakthrough in the understanding of materials occurred in the late 19th century when the american scientist josiah willard gibbs demonstrated that the thermodynamic properties related to atomic structure in various phases are related to the physical properties of a material important elements of modern materials science are a product of the space race the understanding and engineering of the metallic alloys and silica and carbon materials used in the construction of space vehicles enabling the exploration of space materials science has driven and been driven by the development of revolutionary technologies such as plastics semiconductors and biomaterials
before the 1960s and in some cases decades after many materials science departments were named metallurgy departments reflecting the 19th and early 20th century emphasis on metals the growth of materials science in the united states was catalyzed in part by the advanced research projects agency which funded a series of university-hosted laboratories in the early 1960s to expand the national program of basic research and training in the materials sciences the field has since broadened to include every class of materials including ceramics polymers semiconductors magnetic materials medical implant materials biological materials and nanomaterials

a material is defined as a substance most often a solid but other condensed phases can be included that is intended to be used for certain applications there are a myriad of materials around us—they can be found in anything from buildings to spacecraft materials can generally be divided into two classes crystalline and non-crystalline the traditional examples of materials are metals semiconductors ceramics and polymers new and advanced materials that are being developed include nanomaterials and biomaterials etc
the basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials and relating them to their properties once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation heshe can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application the major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form these characteristics taken together and related through the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics govern a material’s microstructure and thus its properties
as mentioned above structure is one of the most important components of the field of materials science materials science examines the structure of materials from the atomic scale all the way up to the macro scale characterization is the way materials scientists examine the structure of a material this involves techniques such as diffraction with x-rays electrons or neutrons and various forms of spectroscopy and chemical analysis such as raman spectroscopy energy-dispersive spectroscopy eds chromatography thermal analysis electron microscope analysis etc structure is studied at various levels as detailed below
this deals with the atoms of the materials and how they are arranged to give molecules crystals etc much of the electrical magnetic and chemical properties of materials arise from this level of structure the length scales involved are in angstroms the way in which the atoms and molecules are bonded and arranged is fundamental to studying the properties and behavior of any material
nanostructure deals with objects and structures that are in the 1—100 nm range in many materials atoms or molecules agglomerate together to form objects at the nanoscale this leads to many interesting electrical magnetic optical and mechanical properties
in describing nanostructures it is necessary to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale nanotextured surfaces have one dimension on the nanoscale ie only the thickness of the surface of an object is between 0.1 and 100 nm nanotubes have two dimensions on the nanoscale ie the diameter of the tube is between 0.1 and 100 nm its length could be much greater finally spherical nanoparticles have three dimensions on the nanoscale ie the particle is between 0.1 and 100 nm in each spatial dimension the terms nanoparticles and ultrafine particles ufp often are used synonymously although ufp can reach into the micrometre range the term 'nanostructure' is often used when referring to magnetic technology nanoscale structure in biology is often called ultrastructure
materials whose atomsmolecules form constituents in the nanoscale ie they form nanostructure are called nanomaterials nanomaterials are subject of intense research in the materials science community due to the unique properties that they exhibit
microstructure is defined as the structure of a prepared surface or thin foil of material as revealed by a microscope above 25× magnification it deals with objects from 100 nm to a few cm the microstructure of a material which can be broadly classified into metallic polymeric ceramic and composite can strongly influence physical properties such as strength toughness ductility hardness corrosion resistance highlow temperature behavior wear resistance and so on most of the traditional materials such as metals and ceramics are microstructured
the manufacture of a perfect crystal of a material is physically impossible for example a crystalline material will contain defects such as precipitates grain boundaries hall–petch relationship interstitial atoms vacancies or substitutional atoms the microstructure of materials reveals these defects so that they can be studied
macrostructure is the appearance of a material in the scale millimeters to meters—it is the structure of the material as seen with the naked eye
crystallography is the science that examines the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids crystallography is a useful tool for materials scientists in single crystals the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure in addition physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects the understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects mostly materials do not occur as a single crystal but in poly-crystalline form ie as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations because of this the powder diffraction method which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals plays an important role in structural determination most materials have a crystalline structure but there are some important materials that do not exhibit regular crystal structure polymers display varying degrees of crystallinity and many are completely non-crystalline glass some ceramics and many natural materials are amorphous not possessing any long-range order in their atomic arrangements the study of polymers combines elements of chemical and statistical thermodynamics to give thermodynamic as well as mechanical descriptions of physical properties
to obtain a full understanding of the material structure and how it relates to its properties the materials scientist must study how the different atoms ions and molecules are arranged and bonded to each other this involves the study and use of quantum chemistry or quantum physics solid-state physics solid-state chemistry and physical chemistry are also involved in the study of bonding and structure
materials exhibit myriad properties including the following
the properties of a material determine its usability and hence its engineering application
synthesis and processing involves the creation of a material with the desired micronanostructure from an engineering standpoint a material cannot be used in industry if no economical manufacturing method for it has been developed thus the processing of materials is very important to the field of materials science
different materials require different processingsynthesis techniques for example the processing of metals has historically been very important and is studied under the branch of materials science known as physical metallurgy also chemical and physical techniques are also used to synthesize other materials such as polymers ceramics thin films etc currently new techniques are being developed to synthesize nanomaterials such as graphene
thermodynamics is concerned with heat and temperature and their relation to energy and work it defines macroscopic variables such as internal energy entropy and pressure that partly describe a body of matter or radiation it states that the behavior of those variables is subject to general constraints that are common to all materials not the peculiar properties of particular materials these general constraints are expressed in the four laws of thermodynamics thermodynamics describes the bulk behavior of the body not the microscopic behaviors of the very large numbers of its microscopic constituents such as molecules the behavior of these microscopic particles is described by and the laws of thermodynamics are derived from statistical mechanics
the study of thermodynamics is fundamental to materials science it forms the foundation to treat general phenomena in materials science and engineering including chemical reactions magnetism polarizability and elasticity it also helps in the understanding of phase diagrams and phase equilibrium
kinetics is the study of the rates at which systems that are out of equilibrium change under the influence of various forces when applied to materials science it deals with how a material changes with time moves from non-equilibrium to equilibrium state due to application of a certain field—it details the rate of various processes evolving in materials including shape size composition and structure diffusion is important in the study of kinetics as this is the most common mechanism by which materials undergo change
kinetics is essential in processing of materials because among other things it details how the microstructure changes with application of heat
materials science has received much attention from researchers in most universities many departments ranging from physics to chemistry to chemical engineering—in addition to materials science departments—are involved in materials research research in materials science is vibrant and consists of many avenues the following list is in no way exhaustive it just serves to highlight certain important research areas
nanomaterials describe in principle materials of which a single unit is sized in at least one dimension between 1 and 1000 nanometers 10−9 meter but is usually 1—100 nm
nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to nanotechnology leveraging advances in materials metrology and synthesis which have been developed in support of microfabrication research materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical electronic or mechanical properties
the field of nanomaterials is loosely organized like the traditional field of chemistry into organic carbon-based nanomaterials such as fullerenes and inorganic nanomaterials based on other elements such as silicon examples of nanomaterials include fullerenes carbon nanotubes nanocrystals etc
a biomaterial is any matter surface or construct that interacts with biological systems as a science bio materials is about fifty years oldcitation needed the study of biomaterials is called bio materials science it has experienced steady and strong growth over its history with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine biology chemistry tissue engineering and materials science
biomaterials can be derived either from nature or synthesized in the laboratory using a variety of chemical approaches utilizing metallic components polymers ceramics or composite materials they are often used andor adapted for a medical application and thus comprises whole or part of a living structure or biomedical device which performs augments or replaces a natural function such functions may be benign like being used for a heart valve or may be bioactive with a more interactive functionality such as hydroxy-apatite coated hip implants biomaterials are also used everyday in dental applications surgery and drug delivery for example a construct with impregnated pharmaceutical products can be placed into the body which permits the prolonged release of a drug over an extended period of time a biomaterial may also be an autograft allograft or xenograft used as a transplant material
semiconductors metals and ceramics are used today to form highly complex systems such as integrated electronic circuits optoelectronic devices and magnetic and optical mass storage media these materials form the basis of our modern computing world and hence research into these materials is of vital importance
semiconductors are a traditional example of these types of materials they are materials that have properties that are intermediate between conductors and insulators their electrical conductivities are very sensitive to impurity concentrations and this allows for the use of doping to achieve desirable electronic properties hence semiconductors form the basis of the traditional computer
this field also includes new areas of research such as superconducting materials spintronics metamaterials etc the study of these materials involves knowledge of materials science and solid state physics or condensed matter physics
with the increase in computing power simulating the behavior of materials has become possible this enables materials scientists to discover properties of materials previously unknown as well as to design new materials up until now new materials were found by a time consuming trial and error process but now it is hoped that computational techniques could drastically reduce that time and allow us to tailor materials properties this involves simulating materials at all length scales using methods such as density functional theory molecular dynamics etc
radical materials advances can drive the creation of new products or even new industries but stable industries also employ materials scientists to make incremental improvements and troubleshoot issues with currently used materials industrial applications of materials science include materials design cost-benefit tradeoffs in industrial production of materials processing techniques casting rolling welding ion implantation crystal growth thin-film deposition sintering glassblowing etc and analytical techniques characterization techniques such as electron microscopy x-ray diffraction calorimetry nuclear microscopy hefib rutherford backscattering neutron diffraction small-angle x-ray scattering saxs etc
besides material characterization the material scientistengineer also deals with the extraction of materials and their conversion into useful forms thus ingot casting foundry techniques blast furnace extraction and electrolytic extraction are all part of the required knowledge of a materials engineer often the presence absence or variation of minute quantities of secondary elements and compounds in a bulk material will have a great impact on the final properties of the materials produced for instance steels are classified based on 110 and 1100 weight percentages of the carbon and other alloying elements they contain thus the extraction and purification techniques employed in the extraction of iron in the blast furnace will have an impact on the quality of steel that may be produced
another application of material science is the structures of glass and ceramics typically associated with the most brittle materials bonding in ceramics and glasses uses covalent and ionic-covalent types with sio2 silica or sand as a fundamental building block ceramics are as soft as clay or as hard as stone and concrete usually they are crystalline in form most glasses contain a metal oxide fused with silica at high temperatures used to prepare glass the material is a viscous liquid the structure of glass forms into an amorphous state upon cooling windowpanes and eyeglasses are important examples fibers of glass are also available scratch resistant corning gorilla glass is a well-known example of the application of materials science to drastically improve the properties of common components diamond and carbon in its graphite form are considered to be ceramics
engineering ceramics are known for their stiffness and stability under high temperatures compression and electrical stress alumina silicon carbide and tungsten carbide are made from a fine powder of their constituents in a process of sintering with a binder hot pressing provides higher density material chemical vapor deposition can place a film of a ceramic on another material cermets are ceramic particles containing some metals the wear resistance of tools is derived from cemented carbides with the metal phase of cobalt and nickel typically added to modify properties
filaments are commonly used for reinforcement in composite materials
another application of materials science in industry is the making of composite materials composite materials are structured materials composed of two or more macroscopic phases applications range from structural elements such as steel-reinforced concrete to the thermally insulative tiles which play a key and integral role in nasa's space shuttle thermal protection system which is used to protect the surface of the shuttle from the heat of re-entry into the earth's atmosphere one example is reinforced carbon-carbon rcc the light gray material which withstands re-entry temperatures up to 1510 °c 2750 °f and protects the space shuttle's wing leading edges and nose cap rcc is a laminated composite material made from graphite rayon cloth and impregnated with a phenolic resin after curing at high temperature in an autoclave the laminate is pyrolized to convert the resin to carbon impregnated with furfural alcohol in a vacuum chamber and curedpyrolized to convert the furfural alcohol to carbon in order to provide oxidation resistance for reuse capability the outer layers of the rcc are converted to silicon carbide
other examples can be seen in the plastic casings of television sets cell-phones and so on these plastic casings are usually a composite material made up of a thermoplastic matrix such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene abs in which calcium carbonate chalk talc glass fibers or carbon fibers have been added for added strength bulk or electrostatic dispersion these additions may be referred to as reinforcing fibers or dispersants depending on their purpose
polymers are also an important part of materials science polymers are the raw materials the resins used to make what we commonly call plastics plastics are really the final product created after one or more polymers or additives have been added to a resin during processing which is then shaped into a final form polymers which have been around and which are in current widespread use include polyethylene polypropylene pvc polystyrene nylons polyesters acrylics polyurethanes and polycarbonates plastics are generally classified as commodity specialty and engineering plastics
pvc polyvinyl-chloride is widely used inexpensive and annual production quantities are large it lends itself to an incredible array of applications from artificial leather to electrical insulation and cabling packaging and containers its fabrication and processing are simple and well-established the versatility of pvc is due to the wide range of plasticisers and other additives that it accepts the term additives in polymer science refers to the chemicals and compounds added to the polymer base to modify its material properties
polycarbonate would be normally considered an engineering plastic other examples include peek abs engineering plastics are valued for their superior strengths and other special material properties they are usually not used for disposable applications unlike commodity plastics
specialty plastics are materials with unique characteristics such as ultra-high strength electrical conductivity electro-fluorescence high thermal stability etc
the dividing lines between the various types of plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications for instance polyethylene pe is a cheap low friction polymer commonly used to make disposable shopping bags and trash bags and is considered a commodity plastic whereas medium-density polyethylene mdpe is used for underground gas and water pipes and another variety called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene uhmwpe is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted hip joints
the study of metal alloys is a significant part of materials science of all the metallic alloys in use today the alloys of iron steel stainless steel cast iron tool steel alloy steels make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low mid and high carbon steels an iron carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00% for the steels the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness heat treatment processes such as quenching and tempering can significantly change these properties however cast iron is defined as an iron–carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of chromium nickel and molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels
other significant metallic alloys are those of aluminium titanium copper and magnesium copper alloys have been known for a long time since the bronze age while the alloys of the other three metals have been relatively recently developed due to the chemical reactivity of these metals the electrolytic extraction processes required were only developed relatively recently the alloys of aluminium titanium and magnesium are also known and valued for their high strength-to-weight ratios and in the case of magnesium their ability to provide electromagnetic shielding these materials are ideal for situations where high strength-to-weight ratios are more important than bulk cost such as in the aerospace industry and certain automotive engineering applications
materials science evolved—starting from the 1960s—because it was recognized that to create discover and design new materials one had to approach it in a unified manner thus materials science and engineering emerged at the intersection of various fields such as metallurgy solid state physics chemistry chemical engineering mechanical engineering and electrical engineering
the field is inherently interdisciplinary and the materials scientistsengineers must be aware and make use of the methods of the physicist chemist and engineer the field thus maintains close relationships with these fields also many physicists chemists and engineers also find themselves working in materials science
the overlap between physics and materials science has led to the offshoot field of materials physics which is concerned with the physical properties of materials the approach is generally more macroscopic and applied than in condensed matter physics see important publications in materials physics for more details on this field of study
the field of materials science and engineering is important both from a scientific perspective as well as from an engineering one when discovering new materials one encounters new phenomena that may not have been observe before hence there is lot of science to be discovered when working with materials materials science also provides test for theories in condensed matter physics
material for an engineer is of utmost importance the usage of the appropriate materials is crucial when designing systems and hence engineers are always involved in materials thus materials science is becoming increasingly important in an engineer's education
