a microclimate is a local atmospheric zone where the climate differs from the surrounding area the term may refer to areas as small as a few square meters or square feet for example a garden bed or as large as many square kilometers or square miles
microclimates exist for example near bodies of water which may cool the local atmosphere or in heavily urban areas where brick concrete and asphalt absorb the sun's energy heat up and reradiate that heat to the ambient air the resulting urban heat island is a kind of microclimate microclimates can be found in most places another place this can occur is when the ground is made of tar or concrete because these are man-made objects they do not take in much heat but mainly reradiate it
another contributing factor of microclimate is the slope or aspect of an area south-facing slopes in the northern hemisphere and north-facing slopes in the southern hemisphere are exposed to more direct sunlight than opposite slopes and are therefore warmer for longer periods of time giving the slope a warmer microclimate than the areas around the slope


the area in a developed industrial park may vary greatly from a wooded park nearby as natural flora in parks absorb light and heat in leaves that a building roof or parking lot just radiates back into the air advocates of solar energy argue that widespread use of solar collection can mitigate overheating of urban environments by absorbing sunlight and putting it to work instead of heating the foreign surface objectscitation needed
a microclimate can offer an opportunity as a small growing region for crops that cannot thrive in the broader area this concept is often used in permaculture practiced in northern temperate climates microclimates can be used to the advantage of gardeners who carefully choose and position their plants cities often raise the average temperature by zoning and a sheltered position can reduce the severity of winter roof gardening however exposes plants to more extreme temperatures in both summer and winter
tall buildings create their own microclimate both by overshadowing large areas and by channeling strong winds to ground level wind effects around tall buildings are assessed as part of a microclimate study
microclimates can also refer to purpose-made environments such as those in a room or other enclosure microclimates are commonly created and carefully maintained in museum display and storage environments this can be done using passive methods such as silica gel or with active microclimate control devices
usually if the inland areas have a humid continental climate the coastal areas stay much milder during winter months in contrast to the hotter summers this is the case further north on the american west coast such as in british columbia canada where vancouver has an oceanic wet winter with rare frosts but inland areas that average several degrees warmer in summer have cold and snowy winters
the type of soil found in an area can also affect microclimates for example soils heavy in clay can act like pavement moderating the near ground temperature on the other hand if soil has many air pockets then the heat could be trapped underneath the topsoil resulting in the increased possibility of frost at ground level
two main parameters to define a microclimate within a certain area are temperature and humidity a source of a drop in temperature andor humidity can be attributed to different sources or influences often microclimate is shaped by a conglomerate of different influences and is a subject of microscale meteorology
the well known examples of cold air pool cap effect are gstettneralm sinkhole in austria lowest recorded temperature -53 c  and peter sinks in the us the main criterion on the wind speed in order to create a warm air flow penetration into a cap is the following
where is the froude number --- the brunt–väisälä frequency --- depth of the valley and --- froude number at the threshold wind speed
the presence of permafrost close to the surface in a crater creates a unique microclimate environment
as similar as lava tubes can be to caves which are not formed due to volcanic activity the microclimate within the former is different due to dominant presence of basalt lava tubes and basaltic caves are important astrobiological targets on earth and mars see also martian lava tube
as pointed out by rudolf geiger in his book  not only climate influences the living plant but the opposite effect of the interaction of plants on their environment can also take place and is known as plant climate
artificial reservoirs as well as natural ones create microclimates and often influence the macroscopic climate as well
