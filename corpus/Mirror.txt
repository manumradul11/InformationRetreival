a mirror is an object that reflects light in such a way that for incident light in some range of wavelengths the reflected light preserves many or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light this is different from other light-reflecting objects that do not preserve much of the original wave signal other than color and diffuse reflected light
the most familiar type of mirror is the plane mirror which has a flat screen surface curved mirrors are also used to produce magnified or diminished images or focus light or simply distort the reflected image
mirrors are commonly used for personal grooming or admiring oneself in which case the archaic term looking-glass is sometimes still usedclarification needed decoration and architecture mirrors are also used in scientific apparatus such as telescopes and lasers cameras and industrial machinery most mirrors are designed for visible light however mirrors designed for other wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are also used


the first mirrors used by people were most likely pools of dark still water or water collected in a primitive vessel of some sort the earliest manufactured mirrors were pieces of polished stone such as obsidian a naturally occurring volcanic glass examples of obsidian mirrors found in anatolia modern-day turkey have been dated to around 6000 bc mirrors of polished copper were crafted in mesopotamia from 4000 bc and in ancient egypt from around 3000 bc polished stone mirrors from central and south america date from around 2000 bc onwards in china bronze mirrors were manufactured from around 2000 bc some of the earliest bronze and copper examples being produced by the qijia culture mirrors made of other metal mixtures alloys such as copper and tin speculum metal may have also been produced in china and india mirrors of speculum metal or any precious metal were hard to produce and were only owned by the wealthy
metal-coated glass mirrors are said to have been invented in sidon modern-day lebanon in the first century ad and glass mirrors backed with gold leaf are mentioned by the roman author pliny in his natural history written in about 77 ad the romans also developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead
parabolic mirrors were described and studied in classical antiquity by the mathematician diocles in his work on burning mirrors ptolemy conducted a number of experiments with curved polished iron mirrors and discussed plane convex spherical and concave spherical mirrors in his optics parabolic mirrors were also described by the physicist ibn sahl in the 10th century and ibn al-haytham discussed concave and convex mirrors in both cylindrical and spherical geometries carried out a number of experiments with mirrors and solved the problem of finding the point on a convex mirror at which a ray coming from one point is reflected to another point by the 11th century clear glass mirrors were being produced in moorish spainverification needed
in china people began making mirrors with the use of silver-mercury amalgams as early as 500 ad some time during the early renaissance european manufacturers perfected a superior method of coating glass with a tin-mercury amalgam the exact date and location of the discovery is unknown but in the 16th century venice a city famed for its glass-making expertise became a centre of mirror production using this new technique glass mirrors from this period were extremely expensive luxuries the saint-gobain factory founded by royal initiative in france was an important manufacturer and bohemian and german glass often rather cheaper was also important
the invention of the silvered-glass mirror is credited to german chemist justus von liebig in 1835 his process involved the deposition of a thin layer of metallic silver onto glass through the chemical reduction of silver nitrate this silvering process was adapted for mass manufacturing and led to the greater availability of affordable mirrors nowadays mirrors are often produced by the wet deposition of silver or sometimes aluminum via vacuum deposition directly onto the glass substrate
mirrors are manufactured by applying a reflective coating to a suitable substrate the most common substrate is glass due to its transparency ease of fabrication rigidity hardness and ability to take a smooth finish the reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass on one side and the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other
in classical antiquity mirrors were made of solid metal bronze later silver and were too expensive for widespread use by common people they were also prone to corrosion due to the low reflectivity of polished metal these mirrors also gave a darker image than modern ones making them unsuitable for indoor use with the artificial lighting of the time candles or lanternscitation needed
the method of making mirrors out of plate glass was invented by 16th-century venetian glassmakers on the island of murano who covered the back of the glass with mercury obtaining near-perfect and undistorted reflection for over one hundred years venetian mirrors installed in richly decorated frames served as luxury decorations for palaces throughout europe but the secret of the mercury process eventually arrived in london and paris during the 17th century due to industrial espionage french workshops succeeded in large scale industrialization of the process eventually making mirrors affordable to the masses although mercury's toxicity remained a problemcitation needed
in modern times the mirror substrate is shaped polished and cleaned and is then coated glass mirrors are most often coated with silver or aluminium implemented by a series of coatingscitation needed
the tinii chloride is applied because silver will not bond with the glass the activator causes the tinsilver to harden copper is added for long-term durability the paint protects the coating on the back of the mirror from scratches and other accidental damagecitation needed
in some applications generally those that are cost-sensitive or that require great durability mirrors are made from a single bulk material such as polished metalcitation needed for technical applications such as laser mirrors the reflective coating is typically applied by vacuum deposition on the front surface of the substrate this eliminates refraction and double reflections a weak reflection from the surface of the glass and a stronger one from the reflecting metal and reduces absorption of light by the mirror technical mirrors may use a silver aluminium or gold coating the latter typically for infrared mirrors and achieve reflectivities of 90–95% when new a protective transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent oxidation of the reflective layer applications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability where wide bandwidth is not essential use dielectric coatings which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.999% over a narrow range of wavelengthscitation needed
there are many types of glass mirrors each representing a different manufacturing process and reflection type
an aluminium glass mirror is made of a float glass manufactured using vacuum coating ie aluminium powder is evaporated or sputtered onto the exposed surface of the glass in a vacuum chamber and then coated with two or more layers of waterproof protective paint
a low aluminium glass mirror is manufactured by coating silver and two layers of protective paint on the back surface of glass a low aluminium glass mirror is very clear light transmissive smooth and reflects accurate natural colors this type of glass is widely used for framing presentations and exhibitions in which a precise color representation of the artwork is truly essential or when the background color of the frame is predominantly whitecitation needed
a safety glass mirror is made by adhering a special protective film to the back surface of a silver glass mirror which prevents injuries in case the mirror is broken this kind of mirror is used for furniture doors glass walls commercial shelves or public areascitation needed
a silkscreen printed glass mirror is produced using inorganic color ink that prints patterns through a special screen onto glass various colors patterns and glass shapes are available such a glass mirror is durable and more moisture resistant than ordinary printed glass and can serve for over 20 years this type of glass is widely used for decorative purposes eg on mirrors table tops doors windows kitchen chop boards etccitation needed
a silver glass mirror is an ordinary mirror coated on its back surface with silver which produces images by reflection this kind of glass mirror is produced by coating a silver copper film and two or more layers of waterproof paint on the back surface of float glass which perfectly resists acid and moisture a silver glass mirror provides clear and actual images is quite durable and is widely used for furniture bathroom and other decorative purposescitation needed
decorative glass mirrors are usually handcrafted a variety of shades shapes and glass thickness are often availablecitation needed
a beam of light reflects off a mirror at an angle of reflection equal to its angle of incidence if the size of a mirror is much larger than the wavelength of light that is if the beam of light is shining on a mirror's surface at a ° angle vertically then it reflects from the point of incidence at a ° angle from vertically in the opposite direction this law mathematically follows from the interference of a plane wave on a flat boundary of much larger size than the wavelength
objects viewed in a plane mirror will appear laterally inverted eg if one raises one's right hand the image's left hand will appear to go up in the mirror but not vertically inverted in the image a person's head still appears above his body however a mirror does not usually swap left and right any more than it swaps top and bottom a mirror typically reverses the forwardbackward axis to be precise it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface the normal because left and right are defined relative to front-back and top-bottom the flipping of front and back results in the perception of a left-right reversal in the image if you stand side-on to a mirror the mirror really does reverse your left and right because that's the direction perpendicular to the mirror
looking at an image of oneself with the front-back axis flipped results in the perception of an image with its left-right axis flipped when reflected in the mirror your right hand remains directly opposite your real right hand but it is perceived as the left hand of your image when a person looks into a mirror the image is actually front-back reversed which is an effect similar to the hollow-mask illusion notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object
for things that may be considered as two-dimensional objects like text front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal in the same way that text on a piece of paper appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind text held facing a mirror will appear reversed because the observer is behind the text another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies to turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction to look in another direction human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis this causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal if a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between hisher legs up-down will appear reversed but not left-right this sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself as with a three-dimensional object
mirrors are commonly used as aids to personal grooming they may range from small sizes good to carry with oneself to full body sized they my be handheld mobile fixed or adjustable
with the sun as light source a mirror can be used to signal by variations in the orientation of the mirror the signal can be used over long distances possibly up to 60 kilometres on a clear day this technique was used by native american tribes and numerous militaries to transmit information between distant outposts
mirrors can also be used for search to attract the attention of search and rescue helicopters specialized signalling mirrors are available and are often included in military survival kits
microscopic mirrors are a core element of many of the largest high-definition televisions and video projectors a common technology of this type is texas instruments' dlp a dlp chip is a postage stamp-sized microchip whose surface is an array of millions of microscopic mirrors the picture is created as the individual mirrors move to either reflect light toward the projection surface pixel on or toward a light absorbing surface pixel off
other projection technologies involving mirrors include lcos like a dlp chip lcos is a microchip of similar size but rather than millions of individual mirrors there is a single mirror that is actively shielded by a liquid crystal matrix with up to millions of pixels the picture formed as light is either reflected toward the projection surface pixel on or absorbed by the activated lcd pixels pixel off lcos-based televisions and projectors often use 3 chips one for each primary color
large mirrors are used in rear projection televisions light for example from a dlp as mentioned above is folded by one or more mirrors so that the television set is compact
mirrors are integral parts of a solar power plant the one shown in the picture to the right uses concentrated solar power from an array of parabolic troughs
telescopes and other precision instruments use front silvered or first surface mirrors where the reflecting surface is placed on the front or first surface of the glass this eliminates reflection from glass surface ordinary back mirrors have some of them use silver but most are aluminium which is more reflective at short wavelengths than silver all of these coatings are easily damaged and require special handling they reflect 90% to 95% of the incident light when new the coatings are typically applied by vacuum deposition a protective overcoat is usually applied before the mirror is removed from the vacuum because the coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air front silvered mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality there are optical mirrors such as mangin mirrors that are second surface mirrors reflective coating on the rear surface as part of their optical designs usually to correct optical aberrations
the reflectivity of the mirror coating can be measured using a reflectometer and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light this is exploited in some optical work to make cold mirrors and hot mirrors a cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to infrared light
a hot mirror is the opposite the coating preferentially reflects infrared mirror surfaces are sometimes given thin film overcoatings both to retard degradation of the surface and to increase their reflectivity in parts of the spectrum where they will be used for instance aluminum mirrors are commonly coated with silicon dioxide or magnesium fluoride the reflectivity as a function of wavelength depends on both the thickness of the coating and on how it is applied
for scientific optical work dielectric mirrors are often used these are glass or sometimes other material substrates on which one or more layers of dielectric material are deposited to form an optical coating by careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified the best mirrors of this type can reflect >99.999% of the light in a narrow range of wavelengths which is incident on the mirror such mirrors are often used in lasers
in astronomy adaptive optics is a technique to measure variable image distortions and adapt a deformable mirror accordingly on a timescale of milliseconds to compensate for the distortions
although most mirrors are designed to reflect visible light surfaces reflecting other forms of electromagnetic radiation are also called mirrors the mirrors for other ranges of electromagnetic waves are used in optics and astronomy mirrors for radio waves sometimes known as reflectors are important elements of radio telescopes
two or more mirrors aligned exactly parallel and facing each other can give an infinite regress of reflections called an infinity mirror effect some devices use this to generate multiple reflections
it has been said that archimedes used a large array of mirrors to burn roman ships during an attack on syracuse this has never been proven or disproved however it has been put to the test recently on a popular discovery channel show mythbusters a team from mit tried to recreate the famous archimedes death ray they were unsuccessful at starting a fire on the ship previous attempts to light the boat on fire using only the bronze mirrors available in archimedes' time were unsuccessful and the time taken to ignite the craft would have made its use impractical resulting in the mythbusters team deeming the myth busted it was however found that the mirrors made it very difficult for the passengers of the targeted boat to see likely helping to cause their defeat which may have been the origin of the myth see solar power tower for a practical use of this technique
due to its location in a steep-sided valley the italian town of viganella gets no direct sunlight for seven weeks each winter in 2006 a €100000 computer-controlled mirror 8×5 m was installed to reflect sunlight into the town's piazza in early 2007 the similarly situated village of bondo switzerland was considering applying this solution as well in 2013 mirrors were installed to reflect sunlight into the town square in the norwegian town of rjukan mirrors can be used to produce enhanced lighting effects in greenhouses or conservatories
mirrors are a popular design theme in architecture particularly with late modern and post-modernist high-rise buildings in major cities early examples include the campbell center in dallas which opened in 1972 and the john hancock tower in boston
more recently two skyscrapers designed by architect rafael viñoly the vdara in las vegas and 20 fenchurch street in london have experienced unusual problems due to their concave curved glass exteriors acting as respectively cylindrical and spherical reflectors for sunlight in 2010 the las vegas review journal reported that sunlight reflected off the vdara's south-facing tower could singe swimmers in the hotel pool as well as melting plastic cups and shopping bags employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the vdara death ray aka the fryscraper in 2013 sunlight reflecting off 20 fenchurch street melted parts of a jaguar car parked nearby and scorching or igniting the carpet of a nearby barber shop this building had been nicknamed the walkie-talkie because its shape was supposedly similar to a certain model of two-way radio but after its tendency to overheat surrounding objects became known the nickname changed to the walkie-scorchie
painters depicting someone gazing into a mirror often also show the person's reflection this is a kind of abstraction—in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible similarly in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself in the mirror and yet the reflection faces the camera in reality the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case not their own reflectioncitation needed
