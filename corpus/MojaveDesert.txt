the mojave desert pronunciation moʊˈhɑːvi mə- mo-hah-vee is a rain-shadow mostly high desert area that occupies a significant portion of southeastern california and smaller parts of central california southern nevada southwestern utah and northwestern arizona in the united states the mojave desert's boundaries are generally defined by the presence of yucca brevifolia joshua trees considered an indicator species for this desert it is the driest of the north american deserts the desert is believed to support between 1750 and 2000 species of plants
it is roughly rectangular in shape bounded by the great basin desert to the north and the sonoran desert to the south and eastcitation needed the topographical boundaries include the tehachapi mountains to the west and the san gabriel mountains and san bernardino mountains to the south the mountain boundaries are quite distinct since they are outlined by the two largest faults in california the san andreas and garlock faults the mojave desert displays typical basin and range topography higher elevations above 2000 feet 610 m in the mojave are commonly referred to as the high desert however death valley is the lowest elevation in north america at 282 feet 86 m below sea level and is one of the mojave desert's more notorious places it occupies less than 50000 square miles making it the smallest of the north american deserts
the mojave desert is often referred to as the high desert in contrast to the low desert the sonoran desert to the south the mojave desert is generally lower than the great basin desert to the northcitation needed the term mojave originates from the spanish language while the spelling mohave comes from modern english both are used today although the mohave tribal nation officially uses the spelling mojave the word is a shortened form of hamakhaave their endonym in their native language which means 'beside the water'
while most of the mojave desert is sparsely populated several large cities can be found there including lancaster palmdale and victorville in california henderson and las vegas the largest in nevada as well as st george in utah there are some research facilities at mojave airport also known as mojave air and space port located within mojave desert


the mojave desert receives fewer than 13 in 330 mm of rain a year and is generally between 2000 and 5000 feet 610 and 1520 m in elevation the mojave desert also contains the mojave national preserve as well as the lowest and hottest place in north america death valley at 282 feet below sea level where the temperature often surpasses 120 °f 49 °c from late june to early august zion national park in utah lies at the junction of the mojave the great basin desert and the colorado plateau despite its aridity the mojave and particularly the antelope valley in its southwest has long been a center of alfalfa production fed by irrigation coming from groundwater and in the 20th century from the california aqueduct
the mojave is a desert of temperature extremes and two distinct seasons winter months bring temperatures dipping to around 20 °f −7 °c on valley floors and below 0 °f −18 °c at higher elevations storms moving from the pacific northwest can bring rain and in some places even snow more often the rain shadow created by the sierra nevada as well as mountain ranges within the desert such as the spring mountains bring only clouds and wind in longer periods between storm systems winter temperatures in valleys can approach 80 °f 27 °c
spring weather continues to be influenced by pacific storms but rainfall is more widespread and occurs less frequently after april by early june it is rare for another pacific storm to have a significant impact on the region's weather and temperatures after the middle of may are normally above 90 °f 32 °c and frequently above 100 °f 38 °c
summer weather is dominated by heat temperatures on valley floors can soar above 120 °f 49 °c and above 130 °f 54 °c at the lowest elevations low humidity high temperatures and low pressure draw in moisture from the gulf of mexico creating thunderstorms across the desert southwest known as the north american monsoon while the mojave does not get nearly the amount of rainfall that the sonoran desert to the south receives monsoonal moisture will create thunderstorms as far west as california's central valley from mid-june through early september
autumn is generally pleasant with one to two pacific storm systems creating regional rain events october is one of the driest and sunniest months in the mojave and temperatures usually remain between 70 °f 21 °c and 90 °f 32 °c on the valley floors
after temperature wind is the most significant weather phenomenon in the mojave across the region windy days are common and also common in areas near the transition between the mojave and the california low valleys including near cajon pass soledad canyon and the tehachapi areas during the june gloom cooler air can be pushed out into the desert from southern california in santa ana wind events hot air from the desert blows out into the los angeles basin and other coastal areas wind farms in these areas generate power from these winds
the other major weather factor in the region is elevation the highest peak within the mojave is charleston peak at 11918 feet 3633 m while the badwater basin in death valley is 279 feet 85 m below sea level accordingly temperature and precipitation ranges wildly in all seasons across the region
the mojave desert has not historically supported a fire regime because of low fuel loads and connectivity however in the last few decades invasive annual plants eg bromus spp schismus spp brassica spp have facilitated fire which has significantly altered many areas of the desert at higher elevations fire regimes are regular but infrequent
the mojave desert is defined by numerous mountain ranges creating its xeric conditions these ranges often create valleys endorheic basins salt pans and seasonal saline lakes when precipitation is high enough these mountain ranges and valleys are part of the basin and range province and the great basin a geologic area of crustal thinning which pulls open valleys over millions of years most of the valleys are internally drained endorheic basins so all precipitation that falls within the valley does not eventually flow to the ocean some of the mojave toward the east in and around the colorado rivervirgin river gorge is within a different geographic domain called the colorado plateau this area is known for its incised canyons high mesas and plateaus and flat strata a unique geographic locality found nowhere else on earth
while the mojave desert itself is sparsely populated it has increasingly become urbanized in recent years the metropolitan areas include las vegas which is the largest city in the mojave with a metropolitan population of around 1.9 million in 2006 st george the largest utah city and northeastern-most metropolitan area in the mojave lancaster the largest california city in the desert and over 850000 people live in areas of the mojave attached to the greater los angeles metropolitan area including palmdale and lancaster referred to as the antelope valley victorville apple valley and hesperia referred to as the victor valley attached to the inland empire metropolitan area the 14th largest in the nation
smaller cities or micropolitan areas in the mojave desert include helendale lake havasu city kingman laughlin bullhead city and pahrump all have experienced rapid population growth since 1990
towns with fewer than 30000 people in the mojave include barstow boron california city helendale joshua tree lone pine mojave needles nipton pioneertown randsburg ridgecrest rosamond yucca valley and twentynine palms in california mesquite and moapa valley in nevada and hurricane in utah
the california portion of the desert also contains edwards air force base and naval air weapons station china lake noted for experimental aviation and weapons projects and the largest marine corps base in the world at twentynine palms the us army also maintains fort irwin & the national training center ntc which is another major training area for the united states military mojave airport is also home to a long term storage facility for large airplanes due to extremely dry non-corrosive weather conditions and a hard ground ideal for parking aircraft the airport also houses the air and space port and was one of the test centres for the virgin galactic fleet
the mojave desert contains a number of ghost towns the most significant of these being the gold-mining town of oatman arizona the silver-mining town of calico california and the old railroad depot of kelso some of the other ghost towns are of the more modern variety created when us route 66 and the lesser-known us route 91 were abandoned in favor of the interstates the mojave desert is crossed by major highways interstate 15 interstate 40 us route 95 us route 395 and california state route 58
other than the colorado river on the eastern half of the mojave few long streams cross the desert the mojave river is an important source of water for the southern parts of the desert the amargosa river flows from the great basin desert south to near beatty nevada then underground through ash meadows before returning to the surface near shoshone california disappearing underground again a short while later and has its final outlet into the southern end of death valley the riverbed passes under sr 127 near dumont dunes before turning north into death valley national park
the mojave desert is also home to the devils playground about 40 miles 64 km of dunes and salt flats going in a northwest-southeasterly direction the devils playground is a part of the mojave national preserve and is located between the town of baker california and providence mountains the cronese mountains are found within the devils playground
the mojave desert is one of the most popular tourism spots in north america primarily because of the gambling destination of las vegas the mojave is also known for its scenic beauty with three national parks – death valley national park joshua tree national park and the mojave national preserve lakes mead mohave and havasu provide water sports recreation and vast off-road areas entice off-road enthusiasts the mojave desert also includes a california state park the antelope valley california poppy reserve located in lancaster hoover dam is a popular tourist destination visitors get a chance to see the structure the hydroelectric power plant and hear the history of the dam's construction during the great depression
besides the major national parks there are other areas of identified significance and tourist interest in the desert such as the big morongo canyon preserve within the colorado desert and the red rock canyon national conservation area 17 miles 27 km west of las vegas both of which are managed by the bureau of land management
among the more popular and unique tourist attractions in the mojave is the self described world's tallest thermometer at 134 feet 41 m high which is located along interstate 15 in baker california the newly renovated kelso depot is the visitor center for the mojave national preserve nearby the massive kelso dunes are a popular recreation spot nipton california located on the northern entrance to the mojave national preserve is a restored ghost town founded in 1885
several attractions and natural features are located in the calico mountains calico ghost town in yermo is administered by san bernardino county the ghost town has several shops and attractions and inspired walter knott to build knott's berry farm the blm also administers rainbow basin and owl canyon two off-the-beaten-path scenic attractions together north of barstow in the calicos the calico early man site in the calico hills east of yermo is believed by some archaeologists including the late louis leakey to show the earliest evidence with lithic stone tools found here of human activity in north america the calico peaks scenically rise above all the destinations
a tour of the mojave desert inspired american songwriter carrie jacobs-bond to compose the parlor song a perfect day in 1909
the flora of the mojave desert help define what is called the mojave desert in that the desert itself is generally considered to be outlined by the extent of growth of one of its plants the joshua tree yucca brevifolia mojave desert flora is not a vegetation type although plants in the area have evolved in isolation because of physical barriers this area includes southeastern california and smaller parts of central california southern nevada southwestern utah and northwestern arizona in the united states the flora are adapted to extremely hot and dry conditions but generally not as extreme as the adaptations needed for survival in the flora of the sonoran desert which has an overlap in its major flora such as the creosote bush larrea tridentata
the us bureau of land management blm manages public lands in the mojave desert as part of its crown jewels of the american west national landscape conservation system it has designated numerous large off-road vehicle open use areas on public lands in the western mojave desert including el mirage jawbone canyon rasor spangler hills stoddard valley dove spring canyon dumont dunes and the world's largest open off-road vehicle use area johnson valley open areas designated for unrestricted vehicle travel in the western mojave desert total 363480 acres 1471.0 km2 several additional open areas dedicated to unrestricted vehicle travel on public lands have been designated in the northern and eastern colorado neco desert in 2002 blm designated all washes in the southeastern third of the neco planning area as also open to unrestricted vehicle travel this was followed in 2003 by blm expanding the off-road vehicle network in the western mojave desert to enhance off-road vehicle recreation opportunity in 2004 relative to the case of center for biological diversity et al plaintiffs v bureau of land management et al defendants the united states district court enjoined all off-road vehicle use in the washes of the neco desert planning area pending issuance of a new biological opiniona a new biological opinion was subsequently issued and blm's open wash designation in the neco planning area was reinstated in 2006 several environmental groups protested an additional route network expansion designated under the west mojave desert wemo plan
in 2009 us district judge susan illston ruled against the blm's proposed designation of additional off-road vehicle use allowance in the western mojave desert according to the ruling the blm violated its own regulations when it designated approximately 5000 miles 8000 km of off-roading routes in 2006 according to judge ilston the blm's designation was significantly flawed because it does not contain a reasonable range of alternatives to limit damage to sensitive habitat judge illston found that the bureau had inadequately analyzed the routes' impacts on air quality soils plant communities riparian habitats and sensitive species such as the endangered mojave fringe-toed lizard pointing out that the desert and its resources are extremely fragile easily scarred and slowly healed
the court also found that the blm failed to follow route designation procedures established in the agency’s own california desert conservation area plan which allowed visitors to create hundreds of illegal ohv routes during the past three decades the plan normally requires the blm to consider the impacts to private property non-motorized recreation opportunity and natural resources before establishing off road areas the adopted west mojave plan amendment was found to have violated the blm's own manual of regulations the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma and the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa the ruling was considered a success for a coalition of conservation groups including the california native plant society friends of juniper flats the alliance for responsible recreation community off-road vehicle watch the center for biological diversity sierra club and the wilderness society who together initiated the legal challenge in late 2006
in 2011 judge illston ruled on a remedy request submitted by the ten involved environmental organizations blm in this ruling was directed to complete a revised wemo route designation complying with all laws and regulations by march 2014 the agency is also required per this ruling to place signs on all off-road vehicle routes which are legal to use create a monitoring plan to determine if illegal vehicle use is occurring and provide additional enforcement to prevent illegal use
