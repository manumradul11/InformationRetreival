nominal pipe size nps is a north american set of standard sizes for pipes used for high or low pressures and temperatures nominal refers to pipe in non-specific terms and identifies the diameter of the hole with a non-dimensional number for example – 2-inch nominal steel pipe consists of many varieties of steel pipe with the only criterion being a 2-inch diameter hole through the center specific pipe is identified by pipe diameter and another non-dimensional number for wall thickness referred to as the schedule sched or sch for example – 2 inch diameter pipe schedule 40 nps is often incorrectly called national pipe size due to confusion with national pipe thread npt the european and international designation equivalent to nps is dn diamètre nominalnominal diameterdurchmesser nach norm in which sizes are measured in millimetres see iso 6708 the term nb nominal bore is also frequently used interchangeably with nps
in march 1927 the american standards association authorized a committee to standardize the dimensions of wrought steel and wrought iron pipe and tubing at that time only a small selection of wall thicknesses were in use standard weight std extra-strong xs and double extra-strong xxs based on the iron pipe size ips system of the day however these three sizes did not fit all applications also in 1939 it was hoped that the designations of std xs and xxs would be phased out by schedule numbers however those original terms are still in common use today although sometimes referred to as standard extra-heavy xh and double extra-heavy xxh respectively since the original schedules were created there have been many revisions and additions to the tables of pipe sizes based on industry use and on standards from api astm and others
stainless steel pipes which were coming into more common use in the mid 20th century permitted the use of thinner pipe walls with much less risk of failure due to corrosion by 1949 thinner schedules 5s and 10s which were based on the pressure requirements modified to the nearest bwg number had been created and other s sizes followed later due to their thin walls the smaller s sizes can not be threaded together according to asme code but must be fusion welded


based on the nps and schedule of a pipe the pipe outside diameter od and wall thickness can be obtained from reference tables such as those below which are based on asme standards b36.10m and b36.19m for example nps 14 sch 40 has an od of 14 inches and a wall thickness of 0.437 inches however the nps and od values are not always equal which can create confusion
the reason for the discrepancy for nps ⅛ to 12 inches is that these nps values were originally set to give the same inside diameter id based on wall thicknesses standard at the time however as the set of available wall thicknesses evolved the id changed and nps became only indirectly related to id and od
for a given nps the od stays fixed and the wall thickness increases with schedule for a given schedule the od increases with nps while the wall thickness stays constant or increases using equations and rules in asme b31.3 process piping it can be shown that pressure rating decreases with increasing nps and constant schedulea
some specifications use pipe schedules called standard wall std extra strong xs and double extra strong xxs although these actually belong to an older system called iron pipe size ips the ips number is the same as the nps number std is identical to sch 40s and 40s is identical to 40 for nps 18 to nps 10 inclusive xs is identical to sch 80s and 80s is identical to 80 for nps 18 to nps 8 inclusive xxs wall is thicker than schedule 160 from nps 18 to nps 6 inclusive and schedule 160 is thicker than xxs wall for nps 8 and larger
blockage or ball test when a pipe is welded or bent the most common method to inspect blockages misalignment ovality and weld bead dimensional conformity is to pass a round ball through the pipe coil or circuit if the inner pipe dimension is to be measured then you should subtract the weld bead if welding is applicable typically the clearance tolerance for the ball must not exceed 1mm allowable ovality of any pipe is measured on the inside dimension of the pipe normally 5% to 10% ovality can be accepted if no other test is conducted to verify ovality or blockages this test must be seen as a standard requirement a flow test can not be used in lieu of a blockage or ball test see pipe dimensional table specification asme b36.10m or b36.19m for pipe dimensions per schedule
stainless steel pipe is most often available in standard weight sizes noted by the s designation for example nps sch 10s however stainless steel pipe can also be available in other schedules
both polyvinyl chloride pipe pvc and chlorinated polyvinyl chloride pipe cpvc are made in nps sizes
tolerance the tolerance on pipe od is +164 .0156inch -132 .0312inch
the term nominal bore is used in australia and new zealand with millimeter measurements hence 'nb50' indicates a nominal bore of 50mm
