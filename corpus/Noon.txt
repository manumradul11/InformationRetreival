noon also midday or noon time is usually defined as 12 o'clock in the daytime the term midday is also used colloquially to refer to an arbitrary period of time in the middle of the day solar noon is when the sun crosses the meridian and is at its highest elevation in the sky at 12 o'clock apparent solar time the local or clock time of solar noon depends on the longitude and date the opposite of noon is midnight
in many cultures in the northern hemisphere noon had ancient geographic associations with the direction south as did midnight with north in some cultures remnants of the noon = south association are preserved in the words for noon in french midi and italian mezzogiorno both of which also refer to the southern parts of the respective countries modern polish ukrainian and serbian go a step farther with the words for noon południe південь пoднe – literally half-day also meaning south and the words for midnight północ північ пoнoħ – literally half-night as with english middle meaning half also meaning north


the word noon is derived from latin nona hora the ninth hour of the day and is related to the liturgical term none the roman and western european medieval monastic day began at 600 am 0600 at the equinox by modern timekeeping so the ninth hour started at what is now 300 pm 1500 at the equinox in english the meaning of the word shifted to midday and the time gradually moved back to 1200 local time that is not taking into account the modern invention of time zones the change began in the 12th century and was fixed by the 14th century
solar noon is the moment when the sun transits the celestial meridian – roughly the time when it is highest above the horizon on that day sun transit time this is also the origin of the terms ante meridiem am and post meridiem pm as noted below the sun is directly overhead at solar noon at the equator on the equinoxes at the tropic of cancer latitude 23°26′13.9″ n on the june solstice and at the tropic of capricorn 23°26′13.9″ s on the december solstice in the northern hemisphere above the tropic of cancer the sun is directly to the south of the observer at solar noon and in the southern hemisphere below the tropic of capricorn it is directly to the north
the elapsed time from local solar noon of one day to the next day is exactly 24 hours only four instances in any particular year this occurs when the effects of earth’s obliquity of ecliptic and its orbital speed around the sun offset each other these four days for the current epoch are centered about feb 11 may 13 july 25 and nov 3
it occurs at only one particular line of longitude each event this line varies year to year since earth’s true year is not an integer number of days not even with the leap year corrections this event time and location also varies due to earth’s orbit being gravitationally perturbed by the planets
these four 24 hour days occur in both n and s hemispheres simultaneously the precise utc times for these four days also mark when the opposite line of longitude 180 degrees away experiences precisely 24 hours from local midnight to local midnight the next day thus four varying great circles of longitude define from year to year when a 24-hour day noon to noon or midnight to midnight occurs
the two longest time spans from noon to noon occur twice each year around jun 20 24 hours plus 13 seconds and around dec 21 24 hours plus 30 seconds
the shortest time spans occur twice each year around march 25 24 hours minus 18 seconds and around sept 13 24 hours minus 22 seconds
noon is commonly indicated by 12 pm and midnight by 12 am while some argue that such usage is improper based on the original latin meanings am stood for ante meridiem and pm for post meridiem meaning before midday and after midday respectively the usage of 12 pm to refer to noon is conventional an earlier standard of indicating noon as 12m or 12m for meridies which was at one time specified in the us gpo government style manual has fallen into relative obscurity the current edition of the gpo makes no mention of itnb 1
however some still consider the use of 12 am and 12 pm confusing and seek a less ambiguous phrasing common alternative methods of representing these times are
