a nuclear power plant is a thermal power station in which the heat source is a nuclear reactor as is typical in all conventional thermal power stations the heat is used to generate steam which drives a steam turbine connected to an electric generator which produces electricity as of 23 april 2014update the iaea report there are 435 nuclear power reactors in operation operating in 31 countries nuclear power plants are usually considered to be base load stations since fuel is a small part of the cost of production


electricity was generated by a nuclear reactor for the first time ever on september 3 1948 at the x-10 graphite reactor in oak ridge tennessee in the united states and was the first nuclear power plant to power a light bulb the second larger experiment occurred on december 20 1951 at the ebr-i experimental station near arco idaho in the united states on june 27 1954 the world's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid started operations at the soviet city of obninsk the world's first full scale power station calder hall in england opened on october 17 1956
the conversion to electrical energy takes place indirectly as in conventional thermal power plants the fission in a nuclear reactor heats the reactor coolant the coolant may be water or gas or even liquid metal depending on the type of reactor the reactor coolant then goes to a steam generator and heats water to produce steam the pressurized steam is then usually fed to a multi-stage steam turbine after the steam turbine has expanded and partially condensed the steam the remaining vapor is condensed in a condenser the condenser is a heat exchanger which is connected to a secondary side such as a river or a cooling tower the water is then pumped back into the steam generator and the cycle begins again the water-steam cycle corresponds to the rankine cycle
a nuclear reactor is a device to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction the most common use of nuclear reactors is for the generation of electric energy and for the propulsion of ships
nuclear reactors usually rely on uranium to fuel the chain reaction uranium is a very heavy metal that is abundant on earth and is found in sea water as well as most rocks naturally occurring uranium is found in two different isotopes uranium-238 u-238 accounting for 99.3% and uranium-235 u-235 accounting for about 0.7% isotopes are atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons thus u-238 has 146 neutrons and u-235 has 143 neutrons different isotopes have different behaviors for instance u-235 is fissile which means that it is easily split and gives off a lot of energy making it ideal for nuclear energy on the other hand u-238 does not have that property despite it being the same element different isotopes also have different half-lives a half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive element to decay u-238 has a longer half-life than u-235 so it takes longer to decay over time this also means that u-238 is less radioactive than u-235
the nuclear reactor is the heart of the plant in its central part the reactor core's heat is generated by controlled nuclear fission with this heat a coolant is heated as it is pumped through the reactor and thereby removes the energy from the reactor heat from nuclear fission is used to raise steam which runs through turbines which in turn powers either ship's propellers or electrical generators
since nuclear fission creates radioactivity the reactor core is surrounded by a protective shield this containment absorbs radiation and prevents radioactive material from being released into the environment in addition many reactors are equipped with a dome of concrete to protect the reactor against both internal casualties and external impacts
the purpose of the steam turbine is to convert the heat contained in steam into mechanical energy the engine house with the steam turbine is usually structurally separated from the main reactor building it is so aligned to prevent debris from the destruction of a turbine in operation from flying towards the reactorcitation needed
in the case of a pressurized water reactor the steam turbine is separated from the nuclear system to detect a leak in the steam generator and thus the passage of radioactive water at an early stage an activity meter is mounted to track the outlet steam of the steam generator in contrast boiling water reactors pass radioactive water through the steam turbine so the turbine is kept as part of the control area of the nuclear power plant
the generator converts kinetic energy supplied by the turbine into electrical energy low-pole ac synchronous generators of high rated power are used
a cooling system removes heat from the reactor core and transports it to another area of the plant where the thermal energy can be harnessed to produce electricity or to do other useful work typically the hot coolant is used as a heat source for a boiler and the pressurized steam from that drives one or more steam turbine driven electrical generators
in the event of an emergency safety valves can be used to prevent pipes from bursting or the reactor from exploding the valves are designed so that they can derive all of the supplied flow rates with little increase in pressure in the case of the bwr the steam is directed into the suppression chamber and condenses there the chambers on a heat exchanger are connected to the intermediate cooling circuit
the water level in the steam generator and nuclear reactor is controlled using the feedwater system the feedwater pump has the task of taking the water from the condensate system increasing the pressure and forcing it into either the steam generators in the case of a pressurized water reactor or directly into the reactor for boiling water reactors
most nuclear plants require two distinct sources of offsite power feeding station service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the plant's switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines in addition in some nuclear plants the turbine generator can power the plant's house loads while the plant is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars before they reach the step-up transformer these plants also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible nuclear power plants are equipped with emergency power
in the united states and canada workers except for management professional such as engineers and security personnel are likely to be members of either the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew or the utility workers union of america uwua or one of the various trades and labor unions representing machinist laborers boilermakers millwrights iron workers etccitation needed
the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs but low direct fuel costs with the costs of fuel extraction processing use and spent fuel storage internalized costs therefore comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants cost estimates take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage or recycling costs in the united states due to the price anderson act with the prospect that all spent nuclear fuelnuclear waste could potentially be recycled by using future reactors generation iv reactors that are being designed to completely close the nuclear fuel cycle
on the other hand construction or capital cost aside measures to mitigate global warming such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading increasingly favor the economics of nuclear power further efficiencies are hoped to be achieved through more advanced reactor designs generation iii reactors promise to be at least 17% more fuel efficient and have lower capital costs while futuristic generation iv reactors promise 10000-30000% greater fuel efficiency and the elimination of nuclear waste
in eastern europe a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania and some potential backers have pulled out where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects
analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties to date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies where many of the risks associated with construction costs operating performance fuel price and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants
following the 2011 fukushima i nuclear accidents costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats however many designs such as the currently under construction ap1000 use passive nuclear safety cooling systems unlike those of fukushima i which required active cooling systems this largely eliminates the necessity to spend more on redundant back up safety equipment
in his book normal accidents charles perrow says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly-coupled nuclear reactor systems such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around an interdisciplinary team from mit has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 – 2055 at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period however the mit study does not take into account improvements in safety since 1970 to date there have been five serious accidents core damage in the world since 1970 one at three mile island in 1979 one at chernobyl in 1986 and three at fukushima-daiichi in 2011 corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation ii reactors this leads to on average one serious accident happening every eight years worldwide
nuclear power plants are some of the most sophisticated and complex energy systems ever designed any complex system no matter how well it is designed and engineered cannot be deemed failure-proof veteran journalist and author stephanie cooke has argued
the reactors themselves were enormously complex machines with an incalculable number of things that could go wrong when that happened at three mile island in 1979 another fault line in the nuclear world was exposed one malfunction led to another and then to a series of others until the core of the reactor itself began to melt and even the world's most highly trained nuclear engineers did not know how to respond the accident revealed serious deficiencies in a system that was meant to protect public health and safety
the 1979 three mile island accident inspired perrow's book normal accidents where a nuclear accident occurs resulting from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system tmi was an example of a normal accident because it was unexpected incomprehensible uncontrollable and unavoidable
perrow concluded that the failure at three mile island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity such modern high-risk systems he realized were prone to failures however well they were managed it was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident' therefore he suggested we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign or if that was not possible to abandon such technology entirely 
a fundamental issue contributing to a nuclear power system's complexity is its extremely long lifetime the timeframe from the start of construction of a commercial nuclear power station through the safe disposal of its last radioactive waste may be 100 to 150 years
there are concerns that a combination of human and mechanical error at a nuclear facility could result in significant harm to people and the environment
operating nuclear reactors contain large amounts of radioactive fission products which if dispersed can pose a direct radiation hazard contaminate soil and vegetation and be ingested by humans and animals human exposure at high enough levels can cause both short-term illness and death and longer-term death by cancer and other diseases
it is impossible for a commercial nuclear reactor to explode like a nuclear bomb since the fuel is never sufficiently enriched for this to occur
nuclear reactors can fail in a variety of ways should the instability of the nuclear material generate unexpected behavior it may result in an uncontrolled power excursion normally the cooling system in a reactor is designed to be able to handle the excess heat this causes however should the reactor also experience a loss-of-coolant accident then the fuel may melt or cause the vessel in which it is contained to overheat and melt this event is called a nuclear meltdown
after shutting down for some time the reactor still needs external energy to power its cooling systems normally this energy is provided by the power grid to which that plant is connected or by emergency diesel generators failure to provide power for the cooling systems as happened in fukushima i can cause serious accidents
nuclear safety rules in the united states do not adequately weigh the risk of a single event that would knock out electricity from the grid and from emergency generators as a quake and tsunami recently did in japan nuclear regulatory commission officials said in june 2011
nuclear reactors become preferred targets during military conflict and over the past three decades have been repeatedly attacked during military air strikes occupations invasions and campaigns
in the us plants are surrounded by a double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored the plant grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards the nrc's design basis threat criterion for plants is a secret and so what size of attacking force the plants are able to protect against is unknown however to scram make an emergency shutdown a plant takes fewer than 5 seconds while unimpeded restart takes hours severely hampering a terrorist force in a goal to release radioactivity
attack from the air is an issue that has been highlighted since the september 11 attacks in the us however it was in 1972 when three hijackers took control of a domestic passenger flight along the east coast of the us and threatened to crash the plane into a us nuclear weapons plant in oak ridge tennessee the plane got as close as 8000 feet above the site before the hijackers’ demands were met
the most important barrier against the release of radioactivity in the event of an aircraft strike on a nuclear power plant is the containment building and its missile shield current nrc chairman dale klein has said nuclear power plants are inherently robust structures that our studies show provide adequate protection in a hypothetical attack by an airplane the nrc has also taken actions that require nuclear power plant operators to be able to manage large fires or explosions—no matter what has caused them
in addition supporters point to large studies carried out by the us electric power research institute that tested the robustness of both reactor and waste fuel storage and found that they should be able to sustain a terrorist attack comparable to the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us spent fuel is usually housed inside the plant's protected zone or a spent nuclear fuel shipping cask stealing it for use in a dirty bomb would be extremely difficult exposure to the intense radiation would almost certainly quickly incapacitate or kill anyone who attempts to do so
in many countries plants are often located on the coast in order to provide a ready source of cooling water for the essential service water system as a consequence the design needs to take the risk of flooding and tsunamis into account the world energy council wec argues disaster risks are changing and increasing the likelihood of disasters such as earthquakes cyclones hurricanes typhoons ﬂooding high temperatures low precipitation levels and severe droughts may lead to fresh water shortages failure to calculate the risk of flooding correctly lead to a level 2 event on the international nuclear event scale during the 1999 blayais nuclear power plant flood while flooding caused by the 2011 tōhoku earthquake and tsunami lead to the fukushima i nuclear accidents
the design of plants located in seismically active zones also requires the risk of earthquakes and tsunamis to be taken into account japan india china and the usa are among the countries to have plants in earthquake-prone regions damage caused to japan's kashiwazaki-kariwa nuclear power plant during the 2007 chūetsu offshore earthquake underlined concerns expressed by experts in japan prior to the fukushima accidents who have warned of a genpatsu-shinsai domino-effect nuclear power plant earthquake disaster
the fukushima nuclear disaster illustrated the dangers of building multiple nuclear reactor units close to one another because of the closeness of the reactors plant director masao yoshida was put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with core meltdowns at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units
the three primary objectives of nuclear safety systems as defined by the nuclear regulatory commission are to shut down the reactor maintain it in a shutdown condition and prevent the release of radioactive material during events and accidents these objectives are accomplished using a variety of equipment which is part of different systems of which each performs specific functions
during everyday routine operations emissions of radioactive materials from nuclear plants are released to the outside of the plants although they are quite slight amounts the daily emissions go into the air water and soil
nrc says nuclear power plants sometimes release radioactive gases and liquids into the environment under controlled monitored conditions to ensure that they pose no danger to the public or the environment and routine emissions during normal operation of a nuclear power plant are never lethal
according to the united nations unscear regular nuclear power plant operation including the nuclear fuel cycle amounts to 0.0002 millisieverts msv annually in average public radiation exposure the legacy of the chernobyl disaster is 0.002 msva as a global average as of a 2008 report and natural radiation exposure averages 2.4 msv annually although frequently varying depending on an individual's location from 1 to 13 msv
in march 2012 prime minister yoshihiko noda said that the japanese government shared the blame for the fukushima disaster saying that officials had been blinded by an image of the country's technological infallibility and were all too steeped in a safety myth
japan has been accused by authors such as journalist yoichi funabashi of having an aversion to facing the potential threat of nuclear emergencies according to him a national program to develop robots for use in nuclear emergencies was terminated in midstream because it smacked too much of underlying danger though japan is a major power in robotics it had none to send in to fukushima during the disaster he mentions that japan's nuclear safety commission stipulated in its safety guidelines for light-water nuclear facilities that the potential for extended loss of power need not be considered however this kind of extended loss of power to the cooling pumps caused the fukushima meltdown

the nuclear power debate is about the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes the debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s when it reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies in some countries
proponents argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source which reduces carbon emissions and can increase energy security if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most western countries they emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors and the operational safety record in the western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants
opponents say that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment these threats include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining processing and transport the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste the environment issue is also regarding discharge of hot water into the sea the hot water modifies the environmental conditions for the marine flora fauna they also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong and there have been many serious nuclear accidents critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology they argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source
nuclear reprocessing technology was developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel reprocessing serves multiple purposes whose relative importance has changed over time originally reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing nuclear weapons with the commercialization of nuclear power the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into mox nuclear fuel for thermal reactors the reprocessed uranium which constitutes the bulk of the spent fuel material can in principle also be re-used as fuel but that is only economic when uranium prices are high or disposal is expensive finally the breeder reactor can employ not only the recycled plutonium and uranium in spent fuel but all the actinides closing the nuclear fuel cycle and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from natural uranium by more than 60 times
nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism the political challenges of repository siting a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle in the united states the obama administration stepped back from president bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research
the vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage puts in place an international framework for nuclear liability however states with a majority of the world's nuclear power plants including the us russia china and japan are not party to international nuclear liability conventions
in the us insurance for nuclear or radiological incidents is covered for facilities licensed through 2025 by the price-anderson nuclear industries indemnity act
under the energy policy of the united kingdom through its nuclear installations act of 1965 liability is governed for nuclear damage for which a uk nuclear licensee is responsible the act requires compensation to be paid for damage up to a limit of £150 million by the liable operator for ten years after the incident between ten and thirty years afterwards the government meets this obligation the government is also liable for additional limited cross-border liability about £300 million under international conventions paris convention on third party liability in the field of nuclear energy and brussels convention supplementary to the paris convention
nuclear decommissioning is the dismantling of a nuclear power plant and decontamination of the site to a state no longer requiring protection from radiation for the general public the main difference from the dismantling of other power plants is the presence of radioactive material that requires special precautions
warranty period of operation of nuclear power plants is 30 years one from factors wear is the destruction of the reactors shell under the action of ionizing radiation
generally speaking nuclear plants were designed for a life of about 30 years newer plants are designed for a 40 to 60-year operating lifecitation needed
decommissioning involves many administrative and technical actions it includes all clean-up of radioactivity and progressive demolition of the plant once a facility is decommissioned there should no longer be any danger of a radioactive accident or to any persons visiting it after a facility has been completely decommissioned it is released from regulatory control and the licensee of the plant no longer has responsibility for its nuclear safety
the nuclear industry says that new technology and oversight have made nuclear plants much safer but 57 small accidents have occurred since the chernobyl disaster in 1986 until 2008 two thirds of these mishaps occurred in the us the french atomic energy agency cea has concluded that technical innovation cannot eliminate the risk of human errors in nuclear plant operationcitation needed
according to benjamin sovacool an interdisciplinary team from mit in 2003 estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 – 2055 at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period however the mit study does not take into account improvements in safety since 1970
nuclear stations are used primarily for base load because of economic considerations the fuel cost of operations for a nuclear plant is smaller than the fuel cost for operation of coal or gas plants there is no cost saving if you run a nuclear plant at less than full capacitycitation needed
however nuclear plants are routinely used in load following mode on a large scale in france although it is generally accepted that this is not an ideal economic situation for nuclear plants unit a at the german biblis nuclear power plant is designed to in- and decrease its output 15% per minute between 40 and 100% of its nominal power boiling water reactors normally have load-following capability implemented by varying the recirculation water flowcitation needed
a new generation of designs for nuclear power plants known as the generation iv reactors are the subject of active research many of these new designs specifically attempt to make fission reactors cleaner safer andor less of a risk to the proliferation of nuclear weapons passively safe plants such as the esbwr are available to be built and other reactors that are designed to be nearly fool-proof are being pursued fusion reactors which are still in the early stages of development diminish or eliminate some of the risks associated with nuclear fission
two 1600 mwe european pressurized reactors eprs are being built in europe and two are being built in china the reactors are a joint effort of french areva and german siemens ag and will be the largest reactors in the world one epr is in olkiluoto finland as part of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant the reactor was originally scheduled to go online in 2009 but has been repeatedly delayed and as of september 2014 has been pushed back to 2018 preparatory work for the epr at the flamanville nuclear power plant in flamanville manche france was started in 2006 with a scheduled completion date of 2012 the french reactor has also been delayed and was projected in 2013 to launch in 2016 the two chinese eprs are part of the taishan nuclear power plant in taishan guangdong the taishan reactors were scheduled to go online in 2014 and 2015 but that has been delayed to 2015 and 2016
as of march 2007update there are seven nuclear power plants under construction in india and five in china
in november 2011 gulf power stated that by the end of 2012 it hopes to finish buying off 4000 acres of land north of pensacola florida in order to build a possible nuclear power plant
in 2010 russia launched a floating nuclear power plant the £100 million vessel the akademik lomonosov is the first of seven plants that will bring vital energy resources to remote russian regions
by 2025 southeast asia nations would have a total of 29 nuclear power plants indonesia will have 4 nuclear power plants malaysia 4 thailand 5 and vietnam 16 from nothing at all in 2011
in 2013 china had 32 nuclear reactors under construction the highest number in the world
expansion at two nuclear power plants in the united states plant vogtle and v c summer nuclear power plant located in georgia and south carolina respectively are scheduled to be completed between 2016 and 2019 the two new plant vogtle reactors and the two new reactors at virgil c summer nuclear plant represent the first nuclear power construction projects in the united states since the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979
several countries have begun thorium-based nuclear power programs thorium is four times more abundant within nature than uranium over 60% of thorium's ore monazite is found in five countries australia the united states india brazil and norway these thorium resources are enough to power current energy needs for thousands of years the thorium fuel cycle is able to generate nuclear energy with a lower output of radiotoxic waste than the uranium fuel cycle
