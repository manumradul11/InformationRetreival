off-the-grid systems are designed to function without the support of remote infrastructure such as an electrical grid in electricity off-grid can be stand-alone power system or mini-grids typically to provide a smaller community with electricity off-grid electrification is an approach to access electricity used in countries and areas with little access to electricity due to scattered or distant population the term off-the-grid otg can refer to living in a self-sufficient manner without reliance on one or more public utilities
off-the-grid homes are autonomous they do not rely on municipal water supply sewer natural gas electrical power grid or similar utility services a true off-grid house is able to operate completely independently of all traditional public utility services the idea has been recently popularized by certain celebrities including ed begley jr who stars in the living with ed television show on the home & garden television hgtv network actress daryl hannah promotes off-grid living and constructed her home in colorado according to those principles as does survival expert and dual survival co-star cody lundin who lives in a self-designed passive solar earth house in the high-desert wilderness of northern arizona collecting rainwater composting waste and paying nothing for utilities


electrical power can be generated on-site with renewable energy sources such as solar particularly with photovoltaics wind micro hydro geothermal with a generator or micro combined heat and power with adequate fuel reserves such a system is called a stand-alone power system in addition it is possible to simply eliminate electric power such as in old order amish and old order mennonite communities
on-site water sources can include a well stream or lake depending on the water source this may include pumps andor filtration rainwater can also be harvested filters can be advanced running off an energy source of boiling and storage
on 13 april 2006 usa today reported that there were some 180000 families living off-grid a figure that has jumped 33% a year for a decade and cited richard perez publisher of home power magazine as the source assuming the same rate of growth there would be a quarter million off-grid households in the united states by late 2007 because many third world citizens have never had the chance to go on the grid current estimates are that 1.7 billion people live off-grid worldwide a wave of tv shows and articles came out after the publication of off the grid inside the movement for more space less government and true independence in modern america by nick rosen in 2010
the concept of a sustainable off-grid community must take into consideration the basic needs of all who live in the community to become truly self-sufficient the community would need to provide all of its own electrical power food shelter and water using renewable energy an on-site water source sustainable agriculture and vertical farming techniques is paramount in taking a community off the grid a recent concept design by eric wichman shows a multi-family community which combines all of these technologies into one self-sufficient neighborhood to grow the community you simply add neighborhoods using the same model as the first a self-sustained community reduces its impact on the environment by controlling its waste and carbon footprint
the state of california is encouraging solar and wind power generation that is connected to the electrical grid to avoid the use of toxic lead acid batteries for night time storage grid-tie systems are generally less expensive than off-grid systems due to the lack of additional equipment like charge controllers and the batteries however some systems may mitigate this difference by using old car batteries that can no longer supply enough current to start a car
it is often done to residential buildings only occasionally occupied such as vacation cabins to avoid high initial costs of traditional utility connections other persons choose to live in houses where the cost of outside utilities is prohibitive or such a distance away as to be impractical in his book how to live off-grid nick rosen lists seven reasons for going off-grid the top two are saving money and reducing the carbon footprint others include survivalists preparing for the collapse of the oil economy and bringing life back to the countryside
canada has about 175 aboriginal and northern off-grid communities defined as a community that is neither connected to the north american electrical grid nor to the piped natural gas network it is permanent or long-term 5 years or more and the settlements have at least 10 permanent buildings aboriginal affairs and northern development canada lists the following environmental concerns for these off-grid communities
in situations where grid parity has been reached it becomes cheaper to generate one's own electricity rather than purchasing it from the grid this depends on equipment costs the availability of renewable energy sources wind sun and the cost of a grid connection for example in certain remote areas a grid connection would be prohibitively expensive resulting in grid parity being reached immediately
the photovoltaic off-grid market has been researched by international institutes universities and market research companies the cumulative installed pv capacity is estimated in 2010 between 1 to 2 gw depending on the source the market research company infinergia has gone further by mapping national cumulative installed off-grid pv capacity on 100 countries worldwide
in africa small and inexpensive pico solar electric lights and solar home systems are becoming readily available inexpensive solar panels lithium ion batteries and high-efficiency led lights make the systems affordable
