open design is the development of physical products machines and systems through use of publicly shared design information open design involves the making of both free and open-source software foss as well as open-source hardware the process is generally facilitated by the internet and often performed without monetary compensation the goals and philosophy are identical to that of the open-source movement but are implemented for the development of physical products rather than software open design is a form of co-creation where the final product is designed by the users rather than an external stakeholder such as a private company


sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing more recently principles of open design have been related to the free software and open source movements in 1997 eric s raymond tim o'reilly and larry augustin established open source as an alternative expression to free software and in 1997 bruce perens published the open source definition in late 1998 dr sepehr kiani a phd in mechanical engineering from mit realized that designers could benefit from open source policies and in early 1999 he convinced dr ryan vallance and dr samir nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications together they established the open design foundation odf as a non-profit corporation and set out to develop an open design definition
the idea of open design was taken up either simultaneously or subsequently by several other groups and individuals the principles of open design are closely similar to those of open-source hardware design which emerged in march 1998 when reinoud lamberts of the delft university of technology proposed on his open design circuits website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software
ronen kadushin coined the title open design in his 2004 masterâ€™s thesis and the term was later formalized in the 2010 open design manifesto
the open-design movement currently unites two trends on one hand people apply their skills and time on projects for the common good perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking for developing countries or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies on the other hand open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who without the copyleft mechanism might not collaborate otherwise there is now also a third trend where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source eg 3d printing but customized local solutions for sustainable development
the open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future in some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects because with 3d models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually it is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate
however there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing creating testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort time and cost required to create the physical artefact although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced see tools mentioned in the fab lab article
open design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives many of these organizations are single funded projects while a few organizations are focusing on an area needing development in some cases eg thingiverse for 3d printable designs or appropedia for open source appropriate technology organizations are making an effort to create a centralized open source design repository as this enables innovation notable organizations include
