the ps10 solar power plant spanish planta solar 10 is the world's first commercial concentrating solar power tower operating near seville in andalusia spain the 11 megawatt mw solar power tower produces electricity with 624 large movable mirrors called heliostats it took four years to build and so far cost €35 million us$46 million ps10 produces about 23400 megawatt-hours mw·h per year for which it receives €271 us$360 per mw·h under its power purchase agreement equating to a revenue of €6.3 million per year


the mirrors were delivered by abengoa the solar receiver was designed and built by tecnical-tecnicas reunidas a spanish engineering company and the solar tower was designed and built by altac another spanish engineering and construction company
each of the mirrors has a surface measuring 1292 square feet 120.0 m2 that concentrates the sun's rays to the top of a 115-meter 377 ft high 40-story tower where a solar receiver and a steam turbine are located the turbine drives a generator producing electricity
the ps10 is located 20 km west of seville which receives at least nine hours of sunshine 320 days per year with 15 hours per day in mid summer the solar receiver at the top of the tower produces saturated steam at 275 °c the energy conversion efficiency is approximately 17%
ps10 is the first of a set of solar power generation plants to be constructed in the same area that will total more than 300 mw by 2013citation needed power generation will be accomplished using a variety of technologies the first two power plants to be brought into operation at sanlúcar la mayor are the ps10 and sevilla pv the largest low concentration system photovoltaic plant in europe
300 mw completed and is operating
total 180 mw
three more plants are planned
total 120 mw
ps20 and az20 are twin 20 mwe tower plants based on the same concept as ps10
the ps10 solar power tower stores heat in tanks as superheated and pressurized water at 50 bar and 285 °c the water evaporates and flashes back to steam releasing energy and reducing the pressure storage is for 30 minutes it is suggested that longer storage is possible but that has not been proven yet in an existing power plant however there are many considerations for using molten salt as an energy storage medium due to the great capability of storing energy for long periods of time without substantial losses another possibility is to use a phase-change material as thermal storage where latent heat is used to store energy
