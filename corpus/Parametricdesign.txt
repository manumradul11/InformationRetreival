parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that together define encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response
parametric design is a paradigm in design where the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures
the term parametric originates from mathematics parametric equation and refers to the use of certain parameters or variables that can be edited to manipulate or alter the end result of an equation or system parametric design is not a new concept and has always formed a part of architecture and designcitation needed the consideration of changing forces such as climate setting culture and use has always formed part of the design process
parametric modeling systems can be divided into two main types
form-finding is one of the strategies implementing a propagation-based system the idea behind form-finding is to optimize certain design goals against a set of design constraints


one of the earliest examples of parametric design was the upside down model of churches by antonio gaudi in his design for the church of colònia güell he created a model of strings weighted down with birdshot to create complex vaulted ceilings and arches by adjusting the position of the weights or the length of the strings he could alter the shape of each arch and also see how this change influenced the arches connected to it he placed a mirror on the bottom of the model to see how it should look upside-down
this method has all the properties of a parametric model input parameters equation output
by modifying individual parameters of these models gaudi could generate different versions of his model while being certain the resulting structure would stand in pure compression instead of having to manually calculate the results of parametric equations he could automatically derive the shape of the catenary curves through the force of gravity acting on the strings
where gaudi used physical laws to speed up his calculation of parametric equations ivan sutherland looked to the processing power of digital computers
sutherland created an interactive computer-aided design program called sketchpad using a light pen users could draw lines and arcs that could be related to each other using constraints these constraints contained all the essential properties of parametric equations users could experiment and explore different designs by altering the parameters of an entity and let sketchpad do the calculations and redraw the geometry according to the constraints imposed upon it
nature has always served as inspiration for architects and designerscitation needed computer technology has given designers and architects the tools to analyse and simulate the complexity observed in nature and apply it to structural building shapes and urban organizational patterns in the 1980s architects and designers started using computers running software developed for the aerospace and moving picture industries to animate form
one of the first architects and theorists that used computers to generate architecture was greg lynn his blob and fold architecture is some of the early examples of computer generated architecture shenzhen bao'an international airport's new terminal 3 finished in 2013 designed by italian architect massimiliano fuksas with parametric design support by the engineering firm knippers helbig is an example for the use of parametric design and production technologies in a large scale building
parametric urbanism is concerned with the study and prediction of settlement patterns architect frei otto distinguishes occupying and connecting as the two fundamental processes that are in involved with all urbanisation studies look at producing solutions that reduce overall path length in systems while maintaining low average detour factor or facade differentiationclarification needed
catia computer aided three-dimensional interactive application was used by architect frank gehry to design some of his award-winning curvilinear buildings such as the guggenheim museum bilbaocitation needed gehry technologies the technology arm of his firm have since created digital project their own parametric design software based on their experience with catia

autodesk maya is a 3d computer graphics software originally developed by alias systems corporation formerly alias|wavefront and currently owned and developed by autodesk inc it is used to create interactive 3d applications including video games animated film tv series or visual effects maya exposes a node graph architecture scene elements are node-based each node having its own attributes and customization as a result the visual representation of a scene is based entirely on a network of interconnecting nodes depending on each other's information for the convenience of viewing these networks there is a dependency and a directed acyclic graph users who are students teachers or veterans or unemplo alongside its more recognized visual workflow maya is equipped with a cross-platform scripting language called maya embedded language mel is provided for scripting and a means to customize the core functionality of the software since many of the tools and commands used are written in it mel or python can be used to engineer modifications plug-ins or be injected into runtime outside these superficial uses of the language user interaction is recorded in mel allowing even inexperienced users to implement subroutines
grasshopper 3d originally explicit history is a plug-in for rhinoceros 3d that presents the users with a visual programming language interface to create and edit geometry
components or nodes are dragged onto a canvas in order to build a grasshopper definition grasshopper is based on graphs see graph discrete mathematics that map the flow of relations from parameters through user-defined functions nodes resulting in the generation of geometry changing parameters or geometry causes to changes to propagate throughout all functions and the geometry to be redrawn
autodesk revit is building information modeling bim software used by architects and other building professionals revit was developed in response to the need for software that could create three-dimensional parametric models that include both geometry and non-geometric design and construction information every change made to an element in revit is automatically propagated through the model to keep all components views and annotations consistent this eases collaboration between teams and ensures that all information floor areas schedules etc are updated dynamically when changes in the model are made
dynamo is an open source graphical programming environment for design dynamo extends building information modeling with the data and logic environment of a graphical algorithm editor
generativecomponents parametric cad software developed by bentley systems was first introduced in 2003 became increasingly used in practice especially by the london architectural community by early 2005 and was commercially released in november 2007 generativecomponents has a strong traditional base of users in academia and at technologically advanced design firmscitation needed generativecomponents is often referred to by the nickname of 'gc' gc epitomizes the quest to bring parametric modeling capabilities of 3d solid modeling into architectural design seeking to provide greater fluidity and fluency than mechanical 3d solid modelingcitation needed
users can interact with the software by either dynamically modeling and directly manipulating geometry or by applying rules and capturing relationships among model elements or by defining complex forms and systems through concisely expressed algorithms the software supports many industry standard file input and outputs including dgn by bentley systems dwg by autodesk stl stereo lithography rhino and others the software can also integrate with building information modeling systems
the software has a published api and uses a simple scripting language both allowing the integration with many different software tools and the creation of custom programs by users
this software is primarily used by architects and engineers in the design of buildings but has also been used to model natural and biological structures and mathematical systems
generative components runs exclusively on microsoft windows operating systems and in english
bentley systems incorporated is offering gc as a technology preview of gc as a free download this is a version of gc that no longer requires bentley's microstation software for it to run and that has features and a user interface focused on computational design
modelur is a parametric urban design software plug-in for trimble sketchup developed by urbs it's primary goal is to help the users create conceptual urban massing in contrast to common cad applications where the user designs buildings with usual dimensions such as width depth and height modelur offers design of built environment through key urban parameters such as number of storeys and gross floor area of a building
modelur calculates key urban control parameters on the fly eg floor area ratio or required number of parking lots delivering urban design information while the development is still evolving this way it helps taking well-informed decision during the earliest stages when design decisions have the highest impact
