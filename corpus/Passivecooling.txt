passive cooling is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or nil energy consumption this approach works either by preventing heat from entering the interior heat gain prevention or by removing heat from the building natural cooling natural cooling utilizes on-site energy available from the natural environment combined with the architectural design of building components eg building envelope rather than mechanical systems to dissipate heat therefore natural cooling depends not only on the architectural design of the building but how it uses the local site natural resources as heat sinks ie everything that absorbs or dissipates heat examples of on-site heat sinks are the upper atmosphere night sky the outdoor air wind and the earthsoil


passive cooling covers all natural processes and techniques of heat dissipation and modulation without the use of energy some authors consider that minor and simple mechanical systems eg pumps and economizers can be integrated in passive cooling techniques as long they are used to enhance the effectiveness of the natural cooling process such applications are also called ‘hybrid cooling systems’ the techniques for passive cooling can be grouped in two main categories
protection from or prevention of heat gains encompasses all the design techniques that minimizes the impact of solar heat gains through the building’s envelope and of internal heat gains that is generated inside the building due occupancy and equipment it includes the following design techniques
the modulation and heat dissipation techniques rely on natural heat sinks to store and remove the internal heat gains examples of natural sinks are night sky earth soil and building mass therefore passive cooling techniques that use heat sinks can act to either modulate heat gain with thermal mass or dissipate heat through natural cooling strategies
ventilation as a natural cooling strategy uses the physical properties of air to remove heat or provide cooling to occupants in select cases ventilation can be used to cool the building structure which subsequently may serve as a heat sink
one specific application of natural ventilation is night flushing
night flushing also known as night ventilation night cooling night purging and nocturnal convective cooling is a passive or semi-passive cooling strategy that requires increased air movement at night to pre-cool the structural elements of a building unlike free cooling which assists in chilling water night flushing cools down the thermal mass to execute night flushing the building envelope typically stays closed during the day causing excess heat gains to be stored in the building's thermal mass the building structure acts as a sink through the day and absorbs internal heat gains from occupants equipment solar radiation energy from conditioning systems and conduction through exterior walls roofs interior walls and ceilings at night when the outside air is cooler and the air is not too humid the envelope is opened allowing cooler air to pass through the building so heat can be dissipated from the structure by convective heat loss  this process reduces the temperature of the indoor air and of the thermal mass inside the building allowing convective conductive and radiant cooling to take place during the day when the building is occupied  night flushing is most effective in climates with a large diurnal swing or a large difference between the daily maximum outdoor temperature and daily minimum outdoor temperature for optimal performance the nighttime outdoor air temperature should fall below the daytime comfort zone limits of 22 °c 72 °f and 60% relative humidity for the night flushing strategy to be effective at reducing indoor temperature and energy usage thermal mass must be sized sufficiently and distributed over a wide enough surface area to absorb the space's daily heat gains and the total air change rate must be high enough to remove the internal heat gains from the space at night there are three ways night flushing can be achieved in a building
there are numerous benefits to using night flushing as a cooling strategy for buildings including improved comfort and a shift in peak energy load energy is most expensive during the day by implementing night flushing the usage of mechanical ventilation is reduced during the day leading to energy and money savings there are also a number of limitations to using night flushing such as usability security reduced indoor air quality and poor room acoustics for natural night flushing the process of manually opening and closing windows every day can be tiresome especially in the presence of insect screens this problem can be eased with automated windows or ventilation louvers such as in the manitoba hydro place natural night flushing also requires windows to be open at night when the building is most likely unoccupied which can raise security issues if outdoor air is polluted night flushing can expose occupants to dangerous conditions inside the building in loud city locations the opening of windows can create poor acoustical conditions inside the building
all objects constantly emit and absorb radiant energy an object will cool by radiation if the net flow is outward which is the case during the night at night the long-wave radiation from the clear sky is less than the long-wave infrared radiation emitted from a building thus there is a net flow to the sky since the roof provides the greatest surface visible to the night sky designing the roof to act as a radiator is an effective strategy there are two types of radiative cooling strategies that utilize the roof surface direct and indirect
evaporative cooling the design relies on the evaporative process of water to cool the incoming air while simultaneously increasing the relative humidity a saturated filter is placed at the supply inlet so the natural process of evaporation can cool the supply air apart from the energy to drive the fans water is the only other resource required to provide conditioning to indoor spaces the effectiveness of evaporative cooling is largely dependent on the humidity of the outside air dryer air produces more cooling a study of field performance results in kuwait revealed that power requirements for an evaporative cooler are approximately 75% less than the power requirements for a conventional packaged unit air-conditioner as for interior comfort a study found that evaporative cooling reduced inside air temperature by 9.6 °c compared to outdoor temperature
earth coupling uses the moderate and consistent temperature of the soil to act as a heat sink to cool a building through conduction this passive cooling strategy is most effective when earth temperatures are cooler than ambient air temperature such as hot climates
