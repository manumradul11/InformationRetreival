polybutylene polybutene-1 poly1-butene pb-1 is a polyolefin or saturated polymer with the chemical formula c4h8n it should not be confused with polybutene a low molecular weight oligomer
polybutylene is produced by polymerisation of 1-butene using supported ziegler-natta catalysts pb-1 is a high molecular weight linear isotactic and semi-crystalline polymer pb-1 combines typical characteristics of conventional polyolefins with certain properties of technical polymers
pb-1 when applied as a pure or reinforced resin can replace materials like metal rubber and engineering polymers it is also used synergistically as a blend element to modify the characteristics of other polyolefins like polypropylene and polyethylene because of its specific properties it is mainly used in pressure piping flexible packaging water heaters compounding and hot melt adhesives


isotactic pb-1 is synthesized commercially using two types of heterogeneous ziegler-natta catalysts the first type of catalyst contains two components a solid pre-catalyst the δ-crystalline form of ticl3 and solution of an organoaluminum cocatalyst such as alc2h53 the second type of pre-catalyst is supported the active ingredient in the catalyst is ticl4 and the support is microcrystalline mgcl2 these catalysts also contain special modifiers organic compounds belonging to the classes of esters or ethers the pre-catalysts are activated by combinations of organoaluminum compounds and other types of organic or organometallic modifiers two most important technological advantages of the supported catalysts are high productivity and a high fraction of the crystalline isotactic polymer they produce at 70–80 °c under standard polymerization conditions
heated up to 190 °c and above pb-1 can easily be compression moulded injection moulded blown to hollow parts extruded and welded it does not tend to crack due to stressdubious – discuss because of its crystalline structure and high molecular weight pb-1 has good resistance to hydrostatic pressure showing very low creep even at elevated temperatures it is flexible resists impact well and has good elastic recovery
isotactic polybutylene crystallizes in three different forms crystallization from solution yields form-iii with the melting point of 106.5 °c cooling from the melt results in the form ii which has melting point of 124 °c and density of 0.89 gcm3 at room temperature it spontaneously converts into the form-i with the melting point of 135 °c and density of 0.95 gcm3
pb-1 generally resists chemicals such as detergents oils fats acids bases alcohol ketones aliphatic hydrocarbons and hot polar solutions including water it shows lower resistance to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons as well as oxidising acids than other polymers such as polysulfone and polyamide 66 additional features include excellent wet abrasion resistance easy melt flowability shear thinning and good dispersion of fillers it is compatible with polypropylene ethylene propylene rubbers and thermoplastic elastomers
some properties
the main use of pb-1 is in flexible pressure piping systems for hot and cold drinking water distribution pre-insulated district heating networks and surface heating and cooling systems iso 15876 defines the performance requirements of pb-1 piping systems the most striking features are weldability temperature resistance flexibility and high hydrostatic pressure resistance the material can be classified pb 125 with a minimum required strength mrs of 12.5 mpa other features include low noise transmission low linear thermal expansion no corrosion and calcification
pb-1 piping systems are no longer being sold in north america see class action lawsuits and removal from building code approved usage below the overall market share in europe and asia is rather small but pb-1 piping systems have shown a steady growth in recent years in certain domestic markets eg kuwait uk korea and spain pb-1 piping systems have a strong position
several pb-1 grades are commercially available for various applications and conversion technologies blown film cast film extrusion coating there are two main fields of application
pb-1 is compatible with a wide range of tackifier resins it offers high cohesive and adhesive strength and helps tailoring the open time of the adhesive up to 30 minutes because of its slow crystallisation kinetics it improves the thermal stability and the viscosity of the adhesive
pb-1 accepts very high filler loadings in excess of 70% in combination with its low melting point it can be employed in halogen-free flame retardant composites or as masterbatch carrier for thermo-sensitive pigments pb-1 disperses easily in other polyolefins and at low concentration acts as processing aid reducing torque andor increasing throughput
other applications include domestic water heaters electrical insulation compression packaging wire and cable shoe soles and polyolefin modification thermal bonding enhancing softness and flexibility of rigid compounds increasing temperature resistance and compression set of soft compounds
plumbing and heating systems made from pb-1 have been used in europe and asia for more than 30 years first reference projects in district heating and floor heating systems in germany and austria from the early 1970s are still in operation today
one example is the installation of pb-1 pipes in the vienna geothermal project 1974 where aggressive geothermal water is distributed at a service temperature of 54 °c and 10 bar pressure other pipe materials in the same installation failed or corroded and had been replaced in the meantime
international standards set minimum performance requirements for pipes made from pb-1 used in hot water applications standardized extrapolation methods predict lifetimes in excess of 50 years at 70 °c and 10 bar
polybutylene plumbing was used in several million homes built in the united states from 1970 to the mid-1990s problems with leaks and broken pipes led to a class action lawsuit cox v shell oil that was settled for $1 billion the leaks were associated with degradation of polybutylene exposed to chlorinated water
polybutylene water pipes are no longer accepted by united states building codes and have been the subject of class action lawsuits in both canada and the us however the pipe is still listed for use in canada
there is evidence to suggest that the presence of chlorine and chloramine compounds in municipal water often deliberately added to retard bacterial growth will cause deterioration of the internal chemical structure of polybyutylene piping and the associated acetal fittings the reaction with chlorinated water appears to be greatly accelerated by tensile stress and is most often observed in material under highest mechanical stress such as at fittings sharp bends and kinks localized stress whitening of the material generally accompanies and precedes decomposition of the polymer in extreme cases this stress-activated chemical corrosion can lead to through perforation and leakage within a few years but it also may not fail for decades fittings with a soft compression seal can give adequate service lifefurther explanation needed
because the chemical reaction of the water with the pipe occurs inside the pipe it is often difficult to assess the extent of deterioration the problem can cause both slow leaks and pipe bursting without any previous warning indication the only long-term solution is to completely replace the polybutylene plumbing throughout the entire building
