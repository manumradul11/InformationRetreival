welcome to wikipedia's energy portal your gateway to the subject of energy and its effects on the world around us this portal is aimed at educating you about energy and all its uses


energy is a property of objects and systems of objects to act against a force to do work explored in branches of physics such as thermodynamics popularly the term is most often used in the context of energy as a public technology energy resources their consumption development depletion and conservation biologically bodies rely on food for energy in the same sense as industry relies on fuels to continue functioning since economic activities such as manufacturing and transportation can be energy intensive energy efficiency energy dependence energy security and price are key concerns increased awareness of the effects of global warming has led to global debate and action for the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions like many previous energy use patterns it is changing not due to depletion or supply constraints but due to problems with waste extraction or geopolitical scenarios
first somehow there is a movement there happened to be a burst of motion first motion implies and embraces energy includes energy in itself that first movement is a systematic one the energy is the ability of that system to perform work after that first movement we have the energy to play with the universe is the result of the work systematically performed by that burst of motion motion can be transferred transformed and converted into different forms whenever we see or sense a work done that means a visible energy from here on radiation of energy electromagnetic radiation and so on is easy to follow
in the context of natural science energy can take several different forms thermal chemical electrical radiant nuclear etc these are often grouped as being either kinetic energy or potential energy many of these forms can be readily transformed into another with the help of a device - from chemical energy to electrical energy using a battery for example most energy available for human use ultimately comes from the sun which generates it with nuclear fusion the enormous potential for fusion and other basic nuclear reactions is expressed by the equation e = mc2
the concepts of energy and its transformations are useful in explaining natural processes on larger scales meteorological phenomena like wind rain lightning and tornadoes all result from energy transformations brought about by solar energy on the planet life itself is critically dependent on biological energy transformations organic chemical bonds are constantly broken and made to make the exchange and transformation of energy possible read more
renewable energy reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011 when it contributed 11.7 percent of total us energy production 2.245 quadrillion btus of energy surpassing energy production from nuclear power 2.125 quadrillion btus 2011 was the first year since 1997 that renewables exceeded nuclear in us total energy production
hydroelectric power is currently the largest producer of renewable power in the us it produced around 6.2% of the nation's total electricity in 2010 which was 60.2% of the total renewable power in the us the united states is the fourth largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world after china canada and brazil
us wind power installed capacity now exceeds 65000 mw and supplies 4% of the nation's electricity texas is firmly established as the leader in wind power development followed by iowa and california the largest solar thermal power station is the ivanpah solar power facility 392 mw south west of las vegas and the segs group of plants in the mojave desert with a total generating capacity of 354 mw large photovoltaic power plants in the usa include solar star 579 mw near rosamond california the desert sunlight solar farm a 550 mw solar power plant in riverside county california and the topaz solar farm a 550 mw photovoltaic power plant in san luis obispo county california the geysers in northern california is the largest complex of geothermal energy production in the world
in his 2012 state of the union address president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and energy efficiency and mentioned the long-standing interior department goal to permit 10000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012 read more

he gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before immigrating to the united states in 1884 to work for thomas edison in new york city he soon struck out on his own with financial backers setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices his patented ac induction motor and transformer were licensed by george westinghouse who also hired tesla for a short time as a consultant his work in the formative years of electric power development was also involved in the corporate struggle between making alternating current or direct current the power transmission standard referred to as the war of currents tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage high-frequency power experiments in new york and colorado springs and made early 1893 pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices he tried to put these ideas to practical use in his ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission which was his unfinished wardenclyffe tower project in his lab he also conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillatorsgenerators electrical discharge tubes and early x-ray imaging he also built a wireless controlled boat one of the first ever exhibited
in 1960 the general conference on weights and measures named the si unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor read more
