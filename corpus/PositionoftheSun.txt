the position of the sun in the sky is a function of both time and the geographic coordinates of the observer on the surface of the earth as the earth moves around the sun during the course of the year the sun appears to move with respect to the fixed stars on the celestial sphere along a path called the ecliptic the earth's rotation about its axis causes the fixed stars to move in the sky in a way that depends on the observer's geographic latitude the time when a given fixed star crosses the observer's meridian depends on the geographic longitude to find the sun's position for a given observer at a given time one may therefore proceed in three steps
this calculation is useful in astronomy navigation surveying meteorology climatology solar energy and for designing sundials


these equations from the astronomical almanac can be used to calculate the apparent coordinates of the sun mean equinox and ecliptic of date to a precision of about 0°.01 36″ for dates between 1950 and 2050
start by calculating n the number of days positive or negative since greenwich noon terrestrial time on 1 january 2000 j2000.0 if you know the julian date for your desired time then
the mean longitude of the sun corrected for the aberration of light is
the mean anomaly of the sun actually of the earth in its orbit around the sun but it is convenient to pretend the sun orbits the earth is
put and in the range 0° to 360° by adding or subtracting multiples of 360° as needed
finally the ecliptic longitude of the sun is
the ecliptic latitude of the sun is nearly
as the ecliptic latitude of the sun never exceeds 0.00033°
and the distance of the sun from the earth in astronomical units is
 and form a complete position of the sun in the ecliptic coordinate system this can be converted to the equatorial coordinate system by calculating the obliquity of the ecliptic  and continuing
right ascension
and declination
in right-handed rectangular equatorial coordinates where the axis is in the direction of the vernal equinox and the axis is 90° to the east in the plane of the celestial equator and the axis is directed toward the north celestial pole  in astronomical units
where the obliquity of the ecliptic is not obtained elsewhere it can be approximated
for use with the above equations
the sun appears to move northward during the northern spring its declination reaches a maximum equal to the angle of the earth's axial tilt 23.44° on the june solstice then decreases until the december solstice when its value is the opposite of -1 times the axial tilt this variation produces the seasons
a graph of solar declination during a year looks like a sine wave with an amplitude of 23.44° but one lobe of the sine wave is several days longer than the other among other differences
imagine that the earth is spherical in a circular orbit around the sun and that its axis is tilted 90° so that the axis itself is in the plane of the orbit similar to uranus at one date in the year the sun would be vertically overhead at the north pole so its declination would be +90° for the next few months the sub-solar point would move toward the south pole at constant speed crossing the lines of latitude at a constant rate so that the solar declination would decrease linearly with time eventually the sun would be over the south pole with a declination of -90° then it would start to move northward at a constant speed thus the graph of the sun's declination as seen from this highly tilted earth would not resemble a sine wave — it would be a sawtooth zig-zagging between plus and minus 90° with linear segments between the maxima and minima
now suppose that the axial tilt decreases the absolute maximum and minimum values of the declination would decrease to equal the axial tilt also the shapes of the maxima and minima on the graph would become less acute pointy being curved to resemble the maxima and minima of a sine wave however even when the axial tilt equals that of the real earth the maxima and minima remain more acute than those of a sine wave
the real earth's orbit is elliptical the earth moves more rapidly around the sun near perihelion in early january than near aphelion in early july this makes processes like the variation of the solar declination happen faster in january than july on the graph this makes the minima more acute than the maxima also since perihelion and aphelion do not happen on exactly the same dates as the solstices the maxima and minima are slightly asymmetrical the rates of change before and after are not quite equal
the graph of apparent solar declination is therefore different in several ways from a sine wave calculating it accurately involves some complexity as shown below
the declination of the sun δ☉ is the angle between the rays of the sun and the plane of the earth's equator the earth's axial tilt called the obliquity of the ecliptic by astronomers is the angle between the earth's axis and a line perpendicular to the earth's orbit the earth's axial tilt changes slowly over thousands of years but its current value of about ε = 23°26' is nearly constant so the change in solar declination during one year is nearly the same as during the next year
at the solstices the angle between the rays of the sun and the plane of the earth's equator reaches its maximum value of 23°26' therefore δ☉ = +23°26' at the northern summer solstice and δ☉ = −23°26' at the southern summer solstice
at the moment of each equinox the center of the sun appears to pass through the celestial equator and δ☉ is 0°
the sun's declination at any given moment is calculated by
where el is the ecliptic longitude essentially the earth's position in its orbit since the earth's orbital eccentricity is small its orbit can be approximated as a circle which causes up to 1° of error the circle approximation means the el would be 90° ahead of the solstices in earth's orbit at the equinoxes so that sinel can be written as sin90+nds=cosnds where nds is the number of days after the december solstice by also using the approximation that arcsinsind·cosnds is close to d·cosnds the following frequently used formula is obtained
where n is the day of the year beginning with n=0 at midnight universal time ut as january 1 begins ie the days part of the ordinal date -1 the number 10 in n+10 is the approximate number of days after the december solstice to january 1 this equation overestimates the declination near the september equinox by up to +1.5° the sine function approximation by itself leads to an error of up to 0.26° and has been discouraged for use in solar energy applications the 1971 spencer formula based on a fourier series is also discouraged for having an error of up to 0.28° an additional error of up to 0.5° can occur in all equations around the equinoxes if not using a decimal place when selecting n to adjust for the time after ut midnight for the beginning of that day so the above equation can have up to 2.0° of error about four times the sun's angular width depending on how it is used
the declination can be more accurately calculated by not making the two approximations using the parameters of the earth's orbit to more accurately estimate el
which can be simplified by evaluating constants to
n is the number of days since midnight ut as january 1 begins ie the days part of the ordinal date -1 and can include decimals to adjust for local times later or earlier in the day the number 2 in n-2 is the approximate number of days after january 1 to the earth's perihelion the number 0.0167 is the current value of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit the eccentricity varies very slowly over time but for dates fairly close to the present it can be considered to be constant the largest errors in this equation are less than ± 0.2° but are less than ± 0.03° for a given year if the number 10 is adjusted up or down in fractional days as determined by how far the previous year's december solstice occurred before or after noon on december 22 these accuracies are compared to noaa's advanced calculations which are based on the 1999 jean meeus algorithm that is accurate to within 0.01°
the above formula is related to a reasonably simple and accurate calculation of the equation of time which is described here
more complicated algorithms correct for changes to the ecliptic longitude by using terms in addition to the 1st-order eccentricity correction above they also correct the 23.44° obliquity which changes very slightly with time corrections may also include the effects of the moon in offsetting the earth's position from the center of the pair's orbit around the sun after obtaining the declination relative to the center of the earth a further correction for parallax is applied which depends on the observer's distance away from the center of the earth this correction is less than 0.0025° the error in calculating the position of the center of the sun can be less than 0.00015° for comparison the sun's width is about 0.5°
the declination calculations described above do not include the effects of the refraction of light in the atmosphere which causes the apparent angle of elevation of the sun as seen by an observer to be higher than the actual angle of elevation especially at low sun elevations for example when the sun is at an elevation of 10° it appears to be at 10.1° the sun's declination can be used along with its right ascension to calculate its azimuth and also its true elevation which can then be corrected for refraction to give its apparent position
in addition to the annual north-south oscillation of the sun's apparent position corresponding to the variation of its declination described above there is also a smaller but more complex oscillation in the east-west direction this is caused by the tilt of the earth's axis and also by changes in the speed of its orbital motion around the sun produced by the elliptical shape of the orbit the principal effects of this east-west oscillation are variations in the timing of events such as sunrise and sunset and in the reading of a sundial compared with a clock showing local mean time as the graph shows a sundial can be up to about 16 minutes fast or slow compared with a clock since the earth rotates at a mean speed of one degree every four minutes relative to the sun this 16-minute displacement corresponds to a shift eastward or westward of about four degrees in the apparent position of the sun compared with its mean position a westward shift causes the sundial to be ahead of the clock
since the main effect of this oscillation concerns time it is called the equation of time using the word equation in a somewhat archaic sense meaning correction the oscillation is measured in units of time minutes and seconds corresponding to the amount that a sundial would be ahead of a clock the equation of time can be positive or negative see the main article for further information
the analemma is a diagram that shows the annual variation of the sun's position on the celestial sphere relative to its mean position as seen from a fixed location on the earth the word analemma is also occasionally but rarely used in other contexts it can be considered as an image of the sun's apparent motion during a year it can be photographed by superimposing pictures taken at the same time of day a few days apart for a year the analemma can also be considered as a graph of the sun's declination usually plotted vertically against the equation of time plotted horizontally usually the scales are chosen so that equal distances on the diagram represent equal angles in both directions on the celestial sphere thus four minutes of time in the equation of time are represented by the same distance as one degree in the declination since the earth rotates at a mean speed of one degree every four minutes relative to the sun
the analemma is drawn as it would be seen in the sky by an observer looking upward if north is shown at the top west is to the right this is usually done even when the analemma is marked on a geographical globe on which the continents etc are shown with west to the left
some analemmas are marked to show the position of the sun on the graph on various dates a few days apart throughout the year this enables the analemma to be used to make simple analog computations of quantities such as the times and azimuths of sunrise and sunset analemmas without date markings are used as decorations on such things as sundials they have little practical usefulness
