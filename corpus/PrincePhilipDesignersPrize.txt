it was agreed in december 2015 that the chartered society of designers should re-introduce and manage the prize which the design council had ceased in 2011 after managing it for 52 years
many csd members have received the award over the years including sir kenneth grange cbe ppcsd rdi david gentleman and latterly sir quentin blake cbe fcsd frsl rdi who was awarded the final prize in 2011
prince philip suggested and agreed various changes to the prize that build on its heritage in order to reflect todayâ€™s design profession including opening the prize to international nominations
