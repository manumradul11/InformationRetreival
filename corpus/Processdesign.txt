in chemical engineering process design is the design of processes for desired physical andor chemical transformation of materials process design is central to chemical engineering and it can be considered to be the summit of that field bringing together all of the field's components
process design can be the design of new facilities or it can be the modification or expansion of existing facilities the design starts at a conceptual level and ultimately ends in the form of fabrication and construction plans
process design is distinct from equipment design which is closer in spirit to the design of unit operations processes often include many unit operations


process design documents serve to define the design and they ensure that the design components fit together they are useful in communicating ideas and plans to other engineers involved with the design to external regulatory agencies to equipment vendors and to construction contractors
in order of increasing detail process design documents include
process designers also typically write operating manuals on how to start-up operate and shut-down the process
documents are maintained after construction of the process facility for the operating personnel to refer to the documents also are useful when modifications to the facility are planned
a primary method of developing the process documents is process flowsheeting
there are several considerations that need to be made when designing any chemical process unit design conceptualization and considerations can begin once product purities yields and throughput rates are all defined
objectives that a design may strive to include
constraints include
other factors that designers may include are
designers usually do not start from scratch especially for complex projects often the engineers have pilot plant data available or data from full-scale operating facilities other sources of information include proprietary design criteria provided by process licensors published scientific data laboratory experiments and input
the advent of low cost powerful computers has aided complex mathematical simulation of processes and simulation software is often used by design engineers simulations can identify weaknesses in designs and allow engineers to choose better alternatives
however engineers still rely on heuristics intuition and experience when designing a process human creativity is an element in complex designs
