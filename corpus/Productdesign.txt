product design as a verb is the process of creating a new product to be sold by a business to its customers a very broad concept it is essentially the efficient and effective generation and development of ideas through a process that leads to new products
due to the absence of a consensually accepted definition that reflects the breadth of the topic sufficiently two discrete yet interdependent definitions are needed one that explicitly defines product design in reference to the artifact the other that defines the product design process in relation to this artifact
product design as a noun the set of properties of an artifact consisting of the discrete properties of the form ie the aesthetics of the tangible good andor service and the function ie its capabilities together with the holistic properties of the integrated form and function
product design process the set of strategic and tactical activities from idea generation to commercialization used to create a product design in a systematic approach product designers conceptualize and evaluate ideas turning them into tangible inventions and products the product designer's role is to combine art science and technology to create new products that people can use their evolving role has been facilitated by digital tools that now allow designers to communicate visualize analyze and actually produce tangible ideas in a way that would have taken greater manpower in the past
product design is sometimes confused with and certainly overlaps with industrial design and has recently become a broad term inclusive of service software and physical product design industrial design is concerned with bringing artistic form and usability usually associated with craft design and ergonomics together in order to mass-produce goods other aspects of product design include engineering design particularly when matters of functionality or utility eg problem-solving are at issue though such boundaries are not always clear


there are various product design processes and many focus on different aspects the process shown below for example is the seven universal stages of creative problem-solving outlined by don koberg and jim bagnell it helps designers formulate their product from ideas this process is usually completed by a group of people ie industrial designers field experts eg prospective users engineers etc depending upon the products involved the process focuses on figuring out what is required brainstorming possible ideas creating mock prototypes and then generating the product however that is not the end of the process at this point product designers would still need to execute the idea making it into an actual product and then evaluate its success by seeing if any improvements are necessary
the product design process has experienced huge leaps in evolution over the last few years with the rise and adoption of 3d printing new consumer-friendly 3d printers can produce dimensional objects and print upwards with a plastic like substance opposed to traditional printers that spread ink across a page
the design process follows a guideline involving three main sections
the latter two sections are often revisited depending on how often the design needs touch-ups to improve or to better fit the criteria this is a continuous loop where feedback is the main component to break it down even more the seven stages specify how the process works analysis consists of two stages concept is only one stage and synthesis encompasses the other four
most product designs fall under one of two categories demand-pull innovation or invention-push innovation
demand-pull happens when there is an opportunity in the market to be explored by the design of a product this product design attempts to solve a design problem the design solution may be the development of a new product or developing a product that's already on the market such as developing an existing invention for another purpose
invention-push innovation happens when there is an advancement in intelligence this can occur through research or it can occur when the product designer comes up with a new product design idea
design expression comes from the combined effect of all elements in a product colour tone shape and size should direct a person's thoughts towards buying the product therefore it is in the product designer's best interest to consider the audiences who are most likely to be the product's end consumers keeping in mind how consumers will perceive the product during the design process will direct towards the product’s success in the market however even within a specific audience it is challenging to cater to each possible personality within that group
the solution to that is to create a product that in its designed appearance and function expresses a personality or tells a story products that carry such attributes are more likely to give off a stronger expression that will attract more consumers on that note it is important to keep in mind that design expression does not only concern the appearance of a product but also its function for example as humans our appearance as well as our actions are subject to people's judgment when they are making a first impression of us people usually do not appreciate a rude person even if they are good looking similarly a product can have an attractive appearance but if its function does not follow through it will most likely drop in regards to consumer interest in this sense designers are like communicators they use the language of different elements in the product to express something
product design is not an easy task the stakeholders involved all demand something different from the product designer and from the design process
stakeholders' needs vary from one another and it is the product designer's job to incorporate those needs into their design
product designers need to consider all of the details the ways people use and abuse objects faulty products errors made in the design process and the desirable ways in which people wish they could use objects many new designs will fail and many won't even make it to market some designs eventually become obsolete the design process itself can be quite frustrating usually taking 5 or 6 tries to get the product design right a product that fails in the marketplace the first time may be re-introduced to the market 2 more times if it continues to fail the product is then considered to be dead because the market believes it to be a failure most new products fail even if it's a great idea all types of product design are clearly linked to the economic health of manufacturing sectors innovation provides much of the competitive impetus for the development of new products with new technology often requiring a new design interpretation it only takes one manufacturer to create a new product paradigm to force the rest of the industry to catch up - fueling further innovation products designed to benefit people of all ages and abilities—without penalty to any group—accommodate our swelling aging population by extending independence and supporting the changing physical and sensory needs we all encounter as we grow older
