propylene glycol also called propane-12-diol is an organic compound with the chemical formula c3h8o2 it is a viscous colorless liquid which is nearly odorless but possesses a faintly sweet taste chemically it is classed as a diol and is miscible with a broad range of solvents including water acetone and chloroform
it is produced on a large scale and is primarily used in the production of polymers but also sees use in food processing as the e-number e1520
the compound is sometimes called α-propylene glycol to distinguish it from the isomer propane-13-diol β-propylene glycol


propylene glycol is a clear colorless and hygroscopic liquid propylene glycol contains an asymmetrical carbon atom so it exists in two enantiomers the commercial product is a racemic mixture pure optical isomers can be obtained by hydration of optically pure propylene oxide
the freezing point of water is depressed when mixed with propylene glycol owing to the effects of dissolution of a solute in a solvent freezing-point depression in general glycols are non-corrosive have very low volatility and very low toxicity however the closely related ethylene glycol a key ingredient in antifreeze is extremely toxic to humans and fatally toxic to many animals
industrially propylene glycol is produced from propylene oxide for food-grade use and global capacity in 1990 was 900000 tonnes per year different manufacturers use either non-catalytic high-temperature process at 200 °c 392 °f to 220 °c 428 °f or a catalytic method which proceeds at 150 °c 302 °f to 180 °c 356 °f in the presence of ion exchange resin or a small amount of sulfuric acid or alkali
final products contain 20% propylene glycol 1.5% of dipropylene glycol and small amounts of other polypropylene glycols further purification produces finished industrial grade or uspjpepbp grade propylene glycol that is typically 99.5% or greater propylene glycol can also be converted from glycerol a biodiesel byproduct this starting material is usually reserved for industrial use because of the noticeable odor and taste that accompanies the final product
s-propanediol may be synthesized from d-mannitol through the following scheme
forty-five percent of propylene glycol produced is used as chemical feedstock for the production of unsaturated polyester resins in this regard propylene glycol reacts with a mixture of unsaturated maleic anhydride and isophthalic acid to give a copolymer this partially unsaturated polymer undergoes further crosslinking to yield thermoset plastics related to this application propylene glycol reacts with propylene oxide to give oligomers and polymers that are used to produce polyurethanes
propylene glycol is used as a humectant e1520 solvent and preservative in food and for tobacco products it is also one of the major ingredients 10-92% along with vegetable glycerin of the e-liquid and cartridges used in electronic cigarettes as well as liquid nicotine where it is aerosolized in the atomizer propylene glycol is also used in various edible items such as coffee-based drinks liquid sweeteners ice cream whipped dairy products and soda vaporizers used for delivery of pharmaceuticals or personal-care products often include propylene glycol among the ingredients propylene glycol is used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals including oral injectable and topical formulations such as for diazepam and lorazepam which are insoluble in water
like ethylene glycol propylene glycol is able to lower the freezing point of water and so it is used as aircraft de-icing fluid water-propylene glycol mixtures dyed pink to indicate the mixture is relatively nontoxic are sold under the name of rv or marine antifreeze propylene glycol is frequently used as a substitute for ethylene glycol in low toxicity environmentally friendly automotive antifreeze it is also used to winterize the plumbing systems in vacant structures the eutectic compositiontemperature is 6040 propylene glycolwater-60 °c the −50 °f−45 °c commercial product is however water rich a typical formulation is 4060
propylene glycol is used in veterinary medicine as an oral treatment for hyperketonaemia in ruminants glucose which can be used in non-ruminants for this purpose is not effective due to its consumption by the resident microbes of the rumen propylene glycol is partially metabolized in the rumen to propionate which can be used as an energy source the remainder is absorbed into the bloodstream and used by the liver for gluconeogenesis
the acute oral toxicity of propylene glycol is very low and large quantities are required to cause perceptible health damage in humans propylene glycol is metabolized in the human body into pyruvic acid a normal part of the glucose-metabolism process readily converted to energy acetic acid handled by ethanol-metabolism lactic acid a normal acid generally abundant during digestion and propionaldehyde a potentially hazardous substance
serious toxicity generally occurs at plasma concentrations over 4 gl in which requires extremely high intake over a relatively short period of time or when used as a vehicle for drugs or vitamins given intravenously or orally it would be nearly impossible to reach toxic levels by consuming foods or supplements which contain at most 1 gkg of pg except for alcoholic beverages which are allowed 5 percent  50gkg cases of propylene glycol poisoning are usually related to either inappropriate intravenous administration or accidental ingestion of large quantities by childrena recent case of propylene glycol poisoning from excess whiskey ingestion has been reported in which a young man required icu admission for respiratory depression and a significant osmolal gap metabolic acidosis
the potential for long-term oral toxicity is also low in one study in 1972 12 rats were provided with feed containing as much as 5% pg over a period of 104 weeks and they showed no apparent ill effects no data on offspring were offered because of its low chronic oral toxicity propylene glycol was classified by the u s food and drug administration as generally recognized as safe gras for use as a direct food additive including frozen foods such as ice cream and frozen desserts the gras designation is specific to its use in food and does not apply to other uses
prolonged contact with propylene glycol is essentially non-irritating to the skin undiluted propylene glycol is minimally irritating to the eye producing slight transient conjunctivitis the eye recovers after the exposure is removed exposure to mists may cause eye irritation as well as upper respiratory tract irritation inhalation of propylene glycol vapors appears to present no significant hazard in ordinary applications however limited human experience indicates that inhalation of propylene glycol mists could be irritating to some individuals it is therefore recommended that propylene glycol not be used in applications where inhalation exposure or human eye contact with the spray mists of these materials is likely such as simulated fogs for theatrical productions or antifreeze solutions for emergency eye wash stations
according to a 2010 study by karlstad university the concentrations of pges counted as the sum of propylene glycol and glycol ethers in indoor air particularly bedroom air has been linked to increased risk of developing numerous respiratory and immune disorders in children including asthma hay fever eczema and allergies with increased risk ranging from 50% to 180% this concentration has been linked to use of water-based paints and water-based system cleansers however the study authors write that glycol ethers and not propylene glycol are the likely culprit
propylene glycol does not cause sensitization and it shows no evidence of being a carcinogen or of being genotoxic
adverse responses to intravenous administration of drugs that use propylene glycol as an excipient have been seen in a number of people particularly with large dosages responses may include hypotension bradycardia qrs and t abnormalities on the ecg arrhythmia cardiac arrest serum hyperosmolality lactic acidosis and haemolysis a high percentage 12% to 42% of directly-injected propylene glycol is eliminated or secreted in urine unaltered depending on dosage with the remainder appearing in its glucuronide-form the speed of renal filtration decreases as dosage increases which may be due to propylene glycol's mild anesthetic  cns-depressant -properties as an alcohol in one case intravenous administration of propylene glycol-suspended nitroglycerin to an elderly man may have induced coma and acidosis
propylene glycol is an approved food additive for dog food under the category of animal feed and is generally recognized as safe for dogs with an ld50 of 9 mlkg the ld50 is higher for most laboratory animals 20 mlkg however it is prohibited for use in food for cats due to links to heinz body anemia
individuals who cannot tolerate propylene glycol experience inflamed dry skin in the facial area or small red dots on the body investigators believe that the incidence of allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol may be greater than 2% in patients with eczema or fungal infections which are very common in countries with lesser sun exposure and lower than normal vitamin d balances therefore propylene glycol allergy is more common in those countries
propylene glycol is known to exert high levels of biochemical oxygen demand bod during degradation in surface waters this process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen needed by aquatic organisms for survival large quantities of dissolved oxygen do in the water column are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycolcitation needed
sufficient dissolved oxygen levels in surface waters are critical for the survival of fish macroinvertebrates and other aquatic organisms if oxygen concentrations drop below a minimum level organisms emigrate if able and possible to areas with higher oxygen levels or eventually die this effect can drastically reduce the amount of usable aquatic habitat reductions in do levels can reduce or eliminate bottom-feeder populations create conditions that favor a change in a community’s species profile or alter critical food-web interactions
