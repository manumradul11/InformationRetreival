psychrometrics or psychrometry or hygrometry are terms used to describe the field of engineering concerned with the determination of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas-vapor mixtures the term derives from the greek psuchron ψυχρόν meaning cold and metron μέτρον meaning means of measurement


although the principles of psychrometry apply to any physical system consisting of gas-vapor mixtures the most common system of interest is the mixture of water vapor and air because of its application in heating ventilating and air-conditioning and meteorology in human terms our thermal comfort is in large part a consequence of not just the temperature of the surrounding air but because we cool ourselves via perspiration the extent to which that air is saturated with water vapor
many substances are hygroscopic meaning they attract water usually in proportion to the relative humidity or above a critical relative humidity such substances include cotton paper cellulose other wood products sugar calcium oxide burned lime and many chemicals and fertilizers industries that use these materials are concerned with relative humidity control in production and storage of such materials
in industrial drying applications such as drying paper manufacturers usually try to achieve an optimum between low relative humidity which increases the drying rate and energy usage which decreases as exhaust relative humidity increases in many industrial applications it is important to avoid condensation that would ruin product or cause corrosion
molds and fungi can be controlled by keeping relative humidity low wood destroying fungi generally do not grow at relative humidities below 75%
the dry-bulb temperature is the temperature indicated by a thermometer exposed to the air in a place sheltered from direct solar radiation the term dry-bulb is customarily added to temperature to distinguish it from wet-bulb and dewpoint temperature in meteorology and psychrometrics the word temperature by itself without a prefix usually means dry-bulb temperature technically the temperature registered by the dry-bulb thermometer of a psychrometer the name implies that the sensing bulb or element is in fact dry wmo provides a 23 page chapter on the measurement of temperature
the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is a thermodynamic property of a mixture of air and water vapor the value indicated by a wet-bulb thermometer often provides an adequate approximation of the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature
the accuracy of a simple wet-bulb thermometer depends on how fast air passes over the bulb and how well the thermometer is shielded from the radiant temperature of its surroundings speeds up to 5000 ftmin ~60 mph are best but it may be dangerous to move a thermometer at that speed errors up to 15% can occur if the air movement is too slow or if there is too much radiant heat present from sunlight for example
a wet bulb temperature taken with air moving at about 1–2 ms is referred to as a screen temperature whereas a temperature taken with air moving about 3.5 ms or more is referred to as sling temperature
a psychrometer is a device that includes both a dry-bulb and a wet-bulb thermometer a sling psychrometer requires manual operation to create the airflow over the bulbs but a powered psychrometer includes a fan for this function knowing both the dry-bulb temperature dbt and wet-bulb temperature wbt one can determine the relative humidity rh from the psychrometric chart appropriate to the air pressure
the ratio of the vapor pressure of moisture in the sample to the saturation pressure at the dry bulb temperature of the sample
the saturation temperature of the moisture present in the sample of air it can also be defined as the temperature at which the vapour changes into liquid condensation usually the level at which water vapor changes into liquid marks the base of the cloud in the atmosphere hence called condensation level so the temperature value that allows this process condensation to take place is called the 'dew point temperature' a simplified definition is the temperature at which the water vapour turns into dew chamunoda zambuko 2012
specific humidity is defined as the proportion of the mass of water vapor per unit mass of the moist air sample dry air plus the water vapor it is closely related to humidity ratio and always lower in value
the mass of water vapor per unit volume of air containing the water vapor this quantity is also known as the water vapor density
analogous to the specific enthalpy of a pure substance in psychrometrics the term quantifies the total energy of both the dry air and water vapour per kilogram of dry air
analogous to the specific volume of a pure substance in psychrometrics the term quantifies the total volume of both the dry air and water vapour per kilogram of dry air
the psychrometric ratio is the ratio of the heat transfer coefficient to the product of mass transfer coefficient and humid heat at a wetted surface it may be evaluated with the following equation
the psychrometric ratio is an important property in the area of psychrometrics as it relates the absolute humidity and saturation humidity to the difference between the dry bulb temperature and the adiabatic saturation temperature
mixtures of air and water vapor are the most common systems encountered in psychrometry the psychrometric ratio of air-water vapor mixtures is approximately unity which implies that the difference between the adiabatic saturation temperature and wet bulb temperature of air-water vapor mixtures is small this property of air-water vapor systems simplifies drying and cooling calculations often performed using psychrometic relationships
humid heat is the constant-pressure specific heat of moist air per unit mass of the dry air
many psychrometric properties are dependent on pressure concept
a psychrometric chart is a graph of the thermodynamic parameters of moist air at a constant pressure often equated to an elevation relative to sea level the ashrae-style psychrometric chart shown here was pioneered by willis carrier in 1904 it depicts these parameters and is thus a graphical equation of state the parameters are
the psychrometric chart allows all the parameters of some moist air to be determined from any three independent parameters one of which must be the pressure changes in state such as when two air streams mix can be modeled easily and somewhat graphically using the correct psychrometric chart for the location's air pressure or elevation relative to sea level for locations at not more than 2000 ft 600 m of altitude it is common practice to use the sea-level psychrometric chart
in the ω-t chart the dry bulb temperature t appears as the abscissa horizontal axis and the humidity ratio ω appear as the ordinate vertical axis a chart is valid for a given air pressure or elevation above sea level from any two independent ones of the six parameters dry bulb temperature wet bulb temperature relative humidity humidity ratio specific enthalpy and specific volume all the others can be determined there are possible combinations of independent and derived parameters
* dry bulb temperature these lines are drawn straight not always parallel to each other and slightly inclined from the vertical position this is the t–axis the abscissa horizontal axis each line represents a constant temperature
* dew point temperature from the state point follow the horizontal line of constant humidity ratio to the intercept of 100% rh also known as the saturation curve the dew point temperature is equal to the fully saturated dry bulb or wet bulb temperatures
* wet bulb temperature these lines are oblique lines that differ slightly from the enthalpy lines they are identically straight but are not exactly parallel to each other these intersect the saturation curve at dbt point
* relative humidity these hyperbolic lines are shown in intervals of 10% the saturation curve is at 100% rh while dry air is at 0% rh
* humidity ratio these are the horizontal lines on the chart humidity ratio is usually expressed as mass of moisture per mass of dry air pounds or kilograms of moisture per pound or kilogram of dry air respectively the range is from 0 for dry air up to 0.03 lbmwlbma on the right hand ω-axis the ordinate or vertical axis of the chart
* specific enthalpy these are oblique lines drawn diagonally downward from left to right across the chart that are parallel to each other these are not parallel to wet bulb temperature lines
specific volume these are a family of equally spaced straight lines that are nearly parallel
the region above the saturation curve is a two-phase region that represents a mixture of saturated moist air and liquid water in thermal equilibrium
the protractor on the upper left of the chart has two scales the inner scale represents sensible-total heat ratio shf the outer scale gives the ratio of enthalpy difference to humidity difference this is used to establish the slope of a condition line between two processes the horizontal component of the condition line is the change in sensible heat while the vertical component is the change in latent heat
psychrometric charts are available in si metric and ip usimperial units they are also available in low and high temperature ranges and for different pressures
the mollier i-x enthalpy - humidity mixing ratio diagram developed by richard mollier in 1923 is an alternative psychrometric chart preferred by many users in scandinavia eastern europe and russia
the underlying psychrometric parameter data for the psychrometric chart and the mollier diagram are identical at first glance there is little resemblance between the charts but if the chart is rotated by ninety degrees and looked at in a mirror the resemblance becomes apparent the mollier diagram coordinates are enthalpy and humidity ratio the enthalpy coordinate is skewed and the lines of constant enthalpy are parallel and evenly spaced the ashrae psychrometric charts since 1961 use similar plotting coordinates some psychrometric charts use dry-bulb temperature and humidity ratio coordinates
