public interest design is a human-centered and participatory design practice that places emphasis on the triple bottom line of sustainable design that includes ecological economic and social issues and on designing products structures and systems that address issues such as economic development and the preservation of the environment
starting in the late 1990s several books convenings and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design since then public interest design—frequently described as a movement or field—has gained public recognition


public interest design grew out of the community design movement which got its start in 1968 after american civil rights leader whitney young issued a challenge to attendees of the american institute of architects aia national convention
   you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights and i am sure this does not come to you as any shock you are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance
the response to young’s challenge was the establishment of community design centers cdcs across the united states cdcs which were often established with the support of area universities provided a variety of design services – such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods
in architecture schools designbuild programs provided outreach to meet local design needs particularly in low-income and underserved areas one of the earliest designbuild programs was yale university’s vlock building project the project which was initiated by students at yale university school of architecture in 1967 requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing
one of the most publicized programs is the auburn university rural studio designbuild program which was founded in 1993 the rural studio’s first project bryant house was completed in 1994 for $16500
interest in public interest design – particularly socially responsible architecture – began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium conferences books and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies
non-profit organizations – including architecture for humanity basic initiative design corps public architecture project h project locus and mass design group – began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions
many public interest design organizations also provide training and service-learning programs for architecture students and graduates in 1999 the enterprise rose architectural fellowship was established giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities
other organizations providing professional training through fellowships include code for america design corps design impact gulf coast community design studio bcworkshop ideoorg
two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the gulf coast community design studio at mississippi state university and the public interest design summer program at the university of texas  in february 2015 portland state university launched the first graduate certificate program in public interest design in the united states
the first professional-level training was conducted in july 2011 by the public interest design institute pidi and held at the harvard graduate school of design
also in 2011 a survey of american institute of architects aia 77% of aia members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially economically and environmentally healthy community
several books have been published that showcase a variety of public interest design projects and practitioners
the annual structures for inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world the first conference which was held in 2000 was called design for the 98% without architects speaking at the conference rural studio co-founder samuel mockbee challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population i believe most of us would agree that american architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditionsin creating architecture and ultimately community it should make no difference which economic or social type is served as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged the structures for inclusion conference is now entering its 14th year to take place march 23–25 2013 hosted by the university of minnesota college of design the event is part of a larger first-of-its-kind public interest design week other recurring events chief among them the design like you give a damn live coordinated by architecture for humanity and the design access summit coordinated by public architecture have also taken shape in recent years

in 2005 adopting a term coined by architect kimberly dowdell the social economic environmental design seed network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders during a meeting hosted by the loeb fellowship at the harvard graduate school of design the seed network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design an evaluation tool called the seed evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with seed network goals and criteria
in 2006 the open architecture network was launched by architecture for humanity in conjunction with co-founder cameron sinclair's ted wish taking on the name worldchanging in 2011 the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design designers of all persuasions can share ideas designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects while protecting their intellectual property rights using the creative commons some rights reserved licensing system
