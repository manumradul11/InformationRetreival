rainwater harvesting is the accumulation and deposition of rainwater for reuse on-site rather than allowing it to run off rainwater can be collected from rivers or roofs and in many places the water collected is redirected to a deep pit well shaft or borehole a reservoir with percolation or collected from dew or fog with nets or other tools its uses include water for gardens livestock irrigation domestic use with proper treatment and indoor heating for houses etc the harvested water can also be used as drinking water longer-term storage and for other purposes such as groundwater recharge


rainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply during regional water restrictions and in developed countries is often used to supplement the main supply it provides water when there is a drought can help mitigate flooding of low-lying areas and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained it also helps in the availability of potable water as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts application of rainwater harvesting in urban water system provides a substantial benefit for both water supply and wastewater subsystems by reducing the need for clean water in water distribution system less generated stormwater in sewer system as well as a reduction in stormwater runoff polluting freshwater bodies
there has been a large body of work focused on the development of life cycle assessment and life cycle costing methodologies to assess the level of environmental impacts and money that can be saved by implementing rainwater harvesting systems
more development and knowledge is required to understand the benefits rainwater harvesting can provide to agriculture many countries especially those with an arid environment use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water to enhance irrigation in arid environments ridges of soil are constructed in order to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills and slopes even in periods of low rainfall enough water is collected in order for crops to grow water can be collected from roofs dams and ponds can be constructed in order to hold large quantities of rainwater so that even on days where there is little to no rainfall there is enough available to irrigate crops
the concentration of contaminants is reduced significantly by diverting the initial flow of run-off water to waste improved water quality can also be obtained by using a floating draw-off mechanism rather than from the base of the tank and by using a series of tanks with draw from the last in series pre-filtration is a common practice used in the industry to ensure that the water entering the tank is free of large sediment pre-filtration is important to keep the system healthy
conceptually a water supply system should match the quality of water with the end use however in most of the developed world high quality potable water is used for all end uses this approach wastes money and energy and imposes unnecessary impacts to the environment supplying rainwater that has gone through preliminary filtration measures for non-potable water uses such as toilet flushing irrigation and laundry may be a significant part of a sustainable water management strategy
rainwater harvesting systems can range in complexity from systems that can be installed with minimal skills to automated systems that require advanced setup and installation systems are ideally sized to meet the water demand throughout the dry season since it must be big enough to support daily water consumption specifically the rainfall capturing area such as a building roof must be large enough to maintain adequate flow the water storage tank size should be large enough to contain the captured watercitation needed
for low-tech systems there are many low-tech methods used to capture rainwater rooftop systems surface water capture and pumping the rainwater that has already soaked into the ground or captured in reservoirs and storing it into tanks cisterns since rainwater harvesting requires financing many poor rural communities are turning to rainwater harvesting micro-financing to fund the building of their systems
before a rainwater harvesting system is built it's helpful to use digital tools for instance if you want to detect if a region has a high rainwater harvesting potential rainwater harvesting gis maps can be made using an online interactive tool or if you need to estimate how much water is needed to fulfill a community's water needs the rain is gain tool helps with this tools like these can save time and money before a commitment to build a system is undertaken in addition to making the project sustainable and last a long time
contemporary system designs require an analysis of not only the economic and technical performance of a system but also the environmental performance life cycle assessment is a methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a precut or systems from cradle-to-grave of its' lifetime devkota et al developed such a methodology for rainwater harvesting and found that the building design eg dimensions and function eg educational residential etc play critical roles in the environmental performance of the system the economic and environmental analysis of sanitations technologies eeast model evaluates the greenhouse gas emissions and cost of such systems over the lifetime of a variety of building types
to address the functional parameters of rainwater harvesting systems a new metric was developed - the demand to supply ratio ds - identifying the ideal building design supply and function demand in regard to the environmental performance of rainwater harvesting for toilet flushing with the idea that supply of rainwater not only saves the potable water but also saves the stormwater entering the combined sewer network thereby requiring treatment the savings in environmental emissions were higher if the buildings are connected to a combined sewer network compared to separate one
rain water harvesting is possible by growing fresh water flooded forests without losing the income from the used submerged land the main purpose of the rain water harvesting is to utilize the locally available rain water to meet water requirements throughout the year without the need of huge capital expenditure this would facilitate availability of uncontaminated water for domestic industrial and irrigation needs
instead of using the roof for catchment the rainsaucer which looks like an upside down umbrella collects rain straight from the sky this decreases the potential for contamination and makes potable water for developing countries a potential application other applications of this free standing rainwater collection approach are sustainable gardening and small plot farming
a dutch invention called the groasis waterboxx is also useful for growing trees with harvested and stored dew and rainwater
traditionally storm water management using detention basins served a single purpose however optimized real-time control optirtc lets this infrastructure double as a source of rainwater harvesting without compromising the existing detention capacity this has been used in the epa headquarters to evacuate stored water prior to storm events thus reducing wet weather flow while ensuring water availability for later reuse this has the benefit of increasing water quality released and decreasing the volume of water released during combined sewer overflow events
generally check dams are constructed across the streams to enhance the percolation of surface water in to the sub soil strata the water percolation in the water impounded area of the check dams can be enhanced artificially many folds by loosening the sub soil strata  overburden by using anfo explosives as used in open cast mining thus local aquifers can be recharged quickly by using the available surface water fully for using in the dry season
around the third century bc the farming communities in balochistan now located in pakistan afghanistan and iran and kutch india used rainwater harvesting for irrigation in ancient tamil nadu india rainwater harvesting was done by chola kings rainwater from the brihadeeswara temple located in balaganpathy nagar thanjavur india was collected in shivaganga tank during the later chola period the vīrānam tank was built 1011 to 1037 ce in cuddalore district of tamil nadu to store water for drinking and irrigation purposes vīrānam is a 16-kilometre 9.9 mi long tank with a storage capacity of 1465000000 cubic feet 41500000 m3
rainwater harvesting was done in the indian states of madhya pradesh maharashtra and chhattisgarhcitation needed in the olden dayswhen? ratanpur in the state of chhattisgarh had around 150 ponds most of the tanks or ponds were utilised in agriculture workscitation needed
in the united kingdom water butts are often found in domestic gardens to collect rainwater which is then used to water the garden however the british government's code for sustainable homes encourages fitting large underground tanks to new-build homes to collect rainwater for flushing toilets washing clothes watering the garden and washing cars this reduces by 50% the amount of mains water used by the home
