reflectance of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in reflecting radiant energy it is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is reflected at an interface the reflectance spectrum or spectral reflectance curve is the plot of the reflectance as a function of wavelength


hemispherical reflectance of a surface denoted r is defined as
where
spectral hemispherical reflectance in frequency and spectral hemispherical reflectance in wavelength of a surface denoted rν and rλ respectively are defined as
where
directional reflectance of a surface denoted rω is defined as
where
spectral directional reflectance in frequency and spectral directional reflectance in wavelength of a surface denoted rνω and rλω respectively are defined as
where
for homogeneous and semi-infinite see halfspace materials reflectivity is the same as reflectance reflectivity is the square of the magnitude of the fresnel reflection coefficient which is the ratio of the reflected to incident electric field as such the reflection coefficient can be expressed as a complex number as determined by the fresnel equations for a single layer whereas the reflectance is always a positive real number
for layered and finite media according to the ciecitation needed reflectivity is distinguished from reflectance by the fact that reflectivity is a value that applies to thick reflecting objects when reflection occurs from thin layers of material internal reflection effects can cause the reflectance to vary with surface thickness reflectivity is the limit value of reflectance as the sample becomes thick it is the intrinsic reflectance of the surface hence irrespective of other parameters such as the reflectance of the rear surface another way to interpret this is that the reflectance is the fraction of electromagnetic power reflected from a specific sample while reflectivity is a property of the material itself which would be measured on a perfect machine if the material filled half of all space
going back to the fact that reflectance is a directional property most surfaces can be divided into those that give specular reflection and those that give diffuse reflection
most real objects have some mixture of diffuse and specular reflective properties
reflection occurs when light moves from a medium with one index of refraction into a second medium with a different index of refraction
specular reflection from a body of water is calculated by the fresnel equations fresnel reflection is directional and therefore does not contribute significantly to albedo which is primarily diffuse reflection
a real water surface may be wavy reflectance assuming a flat surface as given by the fresnel equations can be adjusted to account for waviness
the generalization of reflectance to a diffraction grating which disperses light by wavelength is called diffraction efficiency
reflectance is an important concept in the fields of optics solar thermal energy telecommunication and radar
