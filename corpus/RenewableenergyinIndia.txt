renewable energy in india comes under the purview of the ministry of new and renewable energy india was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of non-conventional energy resources in early 1980s india's cumulative grid interactive or grid tied renewable energy capacity excluding large hydro has reached 33.8 gw of which 66% comes from wind while solar pv contributed nearly 4.59% along with biomass and small hydro power of the renewable energy installed capacity in india

the development of wind power in india began in the 1990s and has significantly increased in the last few years although a relative newcomer to the wind industry compared with denmark or the us domestic policy support for wind power has led india to become the country with the fifth largest installed wind power capacity in the world as of december 2013 the installed capacity of wind power in india was 20149.50 mw mainly spread across tamil nadu 7162.18 mw maharashtra 3021.85 mw gujarat 3174.58 mw karnataka 2135.50 mw rajasthan 2684.65 mw madhya pradesh 386.00 mw andhra pradesh 447.65 mw kerala 35.10 mw west bengal 1.10 mw other states 3.20 mw it is estimated that 6000 mw of additional wind power capacity will be installed in india by 2012 wind power accounts for 6% of india's total installed power capacity and it generates 1.6% of the country's power in its 12th five year plan 2012-2017 the indian government has set a target of adding 18.5 gw of renewable energy sources to the generation mix out of which 11 gw is wind energyindian wind energy alliance iwea is the apex body for the wind energy industry in india it was launched in december 2014 and mr sumant sinha is the chairman of iwea 
these are some of india's largest wind farms
india is densely populated and has high solar insolation an ideal combination for using solar power in india much of the country does not have an electrical grid so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping to begin replacing india's four to five million diesel powered water pumps each consuming about 3.5 kilowatts and off-grid lighting some large projects have been proposed and a 35000 km² area of the thar desert has been set aside for solar power projects sufficient to generate 700 to 2100 gigawatts
the indian solar loan programme supported by the united nations environment programme has won the prestigious energy globe world award for sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems over the span of three years more than 16000 solar home systems have been financed through 2000 bank branches particularly in rural areas of south india where the electricity grid does not yet extend
launched in 2003 the indian solar loan programme was a four-year partnership between unep the unep risoe centre and two of india's largest banks the canara bank and syndicate bank
announced in november 2009 the government of india proposed to launch its jawaharlal nehru national solar mission under the national action plan on climate change with plans to generate 1000 mw of power by 2013 and up to 20000 mw grid-based solar power 2000 mw of off-grid solar power and cover 20 million sq metres with collectors by the end of the final phase of the mission in 2020 the mission aims to achieve grid parity electricity delivered at the same cost and quality as that delivered on the grid by 2020 achieving this target would establish india as a global leader in solar power generation
indian electrical and electronics manufacturers association ieema plays a major role in renewable energy
every year about 55 million tonnes of municipal solid waste msw and 38 billion litres of sewage are generated in the urban areas of india in addition large quantities of solid and liquid wastes are generated by industries waste generation in india is expected to increase rapidly in the future as more people migrate to urban areas and as incomes increase consumption levels are likely to rise as are rates of waste generation it is estimated that the amount of waste generated in india will increase at a per capita rate of approximately 1-1.33% annually this has significant impacts on the amount of land that is and will be needed for disposal economic costs of collecting and transporting waste and the environmental consequences of increased msw generation levels waste energy in india
india has had a long involvement with anaerobic digestion and biogas technologies waste water treatment plants in the country have been established which produce renewable energy from sewage gas however there is significant un-tapped potential also wastes from the distillery sector are on some sites converted into biogas to run in a gas engine to generate onsite power
types of waste waste can be broadly classified into
prominent companies in the waste to energy sector
