renewable energy primary consumption in italy was 14.6 mtoe in 2013 this number has been growing steadily in the last decade and today accounts for a significant percentage of the national energy consumption in 2014 38.2% of the national electric energy consumption came from renewable sources in 2005 this value was 15.4% covering 16.2% of the total energy consumption of the country 5.3% in 2005
all of the 8.047 italian municipalities comune have deployed some source of renewable energy with hydroelectric power being the leading renewable energy source in terms of production solar energy production alone accounted for almost 9% of the total electric consumption in the country in 2014 making italy the country with the highest contribution from solar energy in the world


the urge to produce exclusively green energy in italy came from the need to reduce the country's historical heavy dependence on fossil fuels and supply flows of hydrocarbons coming from eastern europe the middle east and north africa and to comply with the binding international agreements of the kyoto protocol signed in 1997 and implemented in 2005
during the twentieth century italy was at the forefront of technological development and the production of energy from renewable sources in the field of geothermal energy the first plant dates back to 1904 at larderello in tuscany where in 1913 the first geothermal power plant was also built and remained the only one in the world until 1958 with regards to hydropower the first plant in europe was built in paderno d'adda in lombardy between 1895 and 1898 in the solar energy industry the first power plant that could produce steam at 450 °c was built in genoa in 1963 and in 1980 the first solar power tower that uses mirrors was built at adrano in sicily as for the production of wind power the first experimental projects sponsored by the national research council and in collaboration with enel were started in the second half of the seventies as part of the restructuring of the entire system of production and supply of energy that followed the 1973 and 1979 energy crisis
during the eighties and the nineties renewable energy projects drew new life from three co-occurring factors the rapid price increase of crude oil caused by the tension and armed conflicts in the middle east and persian gulf a new public awareness of environmentalism fuelled by the chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the interruption of all construction of nuclear power plants in italy and the ban on enel on the participating in the construction or management of nuclear power plants beyond national borders following the referendum of 1987
between 2005 and 2011 a surge in renewable energy investments and production took place in italy particularly in wind and solar energy during the latter years total electricity produced from solar pv quintupled in 2011 compared to the previous year this was mainly due to a drop in costs and to high incentives introduced since 2005 the italian fossil fuel electricity generation sector underwent a profound crisis many italian power plants burning fossil fuels were running at half capacity and others were in the process of being shut down
by 2011 renewable electricity accounted for the 24.5% of all electric energy produced in italy this percentage grew rapidly and reached 38.5% in 2013 when a spike in hydroelectric production contributed with more than 9 twh the total gross capacity in 2011 was 41352 mw and the total energy produced during the year was 84190 gwh
in 2013 the renewable electricity produced during the year was 106.5 twh
during the first quarter of 2014 renewables generated 398% of all electric energy produced and 491% during april
renewable electricity prodution in gwh from various renewable sources in italy 2012-2015
*excludes contribution from biomass in each year eg approximately an additional 6% 17100gwh of total electricity production in 2013
∗ excludes contribution from biomass
electricity production potential from renewables has been rising although hydroelectric figures vary considerably from one year to the next including biomass energy production of electricity from renewable sources reached a record of around 44% of total electricity production in 2015 production from wind photovoltaic and geothermal sources exceeded hydroelectric production for the first time
italy has a 17 percent target in its total energy use set by the european union for 2020 and is close to meeting its goal having reached 16.2% of renewable energy consumption in 2014
italy has planned to subsidize electric cars transport accounts for a large amount of fossil fuel use so a quick transition to sustainable transport such as electric cars and trams will be a key element of transition to renewable energy use
the italian national renewable energy action plan has a target to reach the total share of renewable energies to 26% 39% in the electricity sector 1709% in the heatingcooling sector and 14% in the transport sector by 2020
on june 16 2013 renewables covered 100% of the entire italian electricity demand for 2 hours
