renewable energy in portugal was the source for 25.7% of energy consumption in 2013  in 2014 63% of portugal's electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources  in 2015 50.4% of power produced in portugal came from renewable sources a drop in comparison to the previous year due to low productivity in the hydroelectric sector because of a dry year
in 2001 the portuguese government launched a new energy policy instrument – the e4 programme energy efficiency and endogenous energies consisting of a set of multiple diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent integrated approach to energy supply and demand by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy endogenous sources the programme sought to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the country’s social fabric while preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions especially the carbon dioxide responsible for climate change
while from 2002-2007 the main priorities were focused on the introduction of natural gas aiming at progressively replacing oil and coal in the energy balance and liberalization of the energy market by opening this former state-owned sector to competition and private investment the emphasis shifted for the next 5 years was on energy efficiency supply and demand sides and use of endogenous renewable energy
during february 2016 an equivalent to 95% of electricity consumed in portugal was produced by renewable sources such as biomass hydropower wind power and solar power a total of 4139 gwh was produced by these sources


the largest hydroelectric power station is at the alto lindoso dam with a capacity of 630 mw portugal has about 100 small hydro systems with a capacity of 256 mw which produce 815 gwhyear
from march 2007 to december 2010 wind power nameplate capacity grew from 1874 to 3937 mw in excluding madeira and azores portugal the major wind turbine manufacturers in the portuguese market are enercon vestas and gamesa
the 240 mw alto minho wind farm in the viana do castelo district became fully operational in november 2008 at the time of completion it was europe's largest on-shore wind farm
other major wind farms which are operating or under construction include arada-montemuro wind farm 112 mw gardunha wind farm 106 mw pinhal interior wind farm 144 mw and ventominho wind farm 240 mw
portugal combines wind and hydropower by using nighttime winds to pump water uphill and sending the water back through generators to produce power the next day
a large photovoltaic power project the serpa solar power plant was completed in portugal one of europe's sunniest areas the 11 megawatt plant covered 150 acres 0.61 km2 and employs 52000 pv panels the panels are raised 2 metres off the ground allowing grazing to continue the plant provides enough energy for 8000 homes and saves an estimated 30000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year
not far from there moura photovoltaic power station is under construction with more than 376000 solar modules it will have an installed capacity of 62mwp when finished the first stage of construction is scheduled for completion in 2008 a solar panel factory is also being built in the city of moura where there are plans to build a research labcitation needed
portugal's main investment for the use of this type of energy is in the azores small scale use of this energy source began in the 1980s in chaves and s pedro do sul continental portugal providing 3 mwt
in the azores the use of geothermal energy is widespread with production in 8 of the 9 islands collectively producing some 235.5 mwt in 2003 25% of the electricity consumed in são miguel was produced by geothermal energy
aguçadoura wave farm was the world's first commercial wave farm when opened on the 23 september 2008 it is located three miles 5 km offshore near póvoa de varzim north of porto the farm uses three pelamis wave energy converters to convert the motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity
in 2011 portugal produced 45 ktoe kiloton of oil equivalent of biogas
