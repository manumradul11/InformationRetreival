electricity from renewable sources in spain represented 42.8% of electricity demand coverage during 2014 the country has a very large wind power capability built up over many years and is one of the world leaders in wind power generation solar power though significant is not as well developed and produced less than a third of that of wind power in 2015
spain has set the target of generating 20% of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2020
in the first half of 2013 the renewable energy sector underwent a major restructuring that will make the official targets very hard to meet 
the story of renewable energy development in spain is both a mixed and unfinished one under previous subsidies the country expanded its renewable base rapidly and helped established a domestic industry in both wind turbine and solar energy however support was drastically cut back following the global financial crisis and new installations stagnated between 2012 and 2015 the debts incurred during the boom period have lead to tougher and retrospective revisions of contracts to providers of renewable energy reducing returns considerably in being one of the first to market countries spain faces the challenge of powerful competitors from countries such as denmark germany and china and ironically a cheaper and more mature renewable energy sector which spain itself helped to pioneer
in 2015 solar power suddenly demonstrated a possible way through the impasse the continued fall in prices for solar systems and spain's abundant sunshine lead to prices for solar power to reach grid price parity suddenly there was the potential for sustained and spontaneous growth in solar installations in spain as households and producers could produce power more economically however the spanish government introduced what has been dubbed the worlds first sun tax on solar installations making them economically less viable as well as draconian fines up to 60 million euros for anyone not complying with the tax
the tax has proved highly controversial on the one hand the government has argued that those generating their own power still rely on the national grid for power backup and so should be liable for contributing to the cost on the other hand the solar industry has argued that the government is simply trying to protect the centralised established power producers who's revenues would be threatened by this competiitve solar threat environmentalists have criticised the tax for artificially blocking spain from continuing its long standing movement to renewable energy production
whatever the merits of both arguments the controversy can only become more heightened as the price of solar energy continues to fall and if pv solar power installed capacity in spain were to continue sliding down the eu league from 12th position in 2014 102.9 kw per 1000 inhabitants in the same year in terms of wind energy production spain was much stronger in 3rd position 495 kw per1000 inhabitants
percentage of total national electricity demand coverage by component renewable sources spain 2015
wind power provided the largest share at 19.1% followed by hydroelectric power at 11.1% solar power provided 5.2% and renewable thermal a further 2% the total electicity supplied demand coverage from renewables was 37.4% of spain's requirements in 2015 the current generational mix of electricity production can be viewed live on the red electrica de espana website
contribution of renewable energy to total electricity generation in spain
percentage of electricity generation by renewables 2006-2015
sharp variation from one year to the next is largely due to the substantial differences in hydroelectric production from one year to the next excluding hydroelectric production electricity generation from renewable energy sources grew from around 10 percent in 2006 to 26.3 percent of demand coverage in 2015 most of the growth occurred in the years leading up to 2012 with little change in baseline capacity between 2012 and 2015 renewable energy generated electricity had a record year in 2014 when it supplied 42.8% of spain's national demand

in 2014 spain was the world's fourth biggest producer of wind power in that year the year-end installed capacity was 23 gw and the annual production was 51439 gwh a share of total electricity consumption of 21.1% installed capacity grew from around 0.8gw in 1998 to approximately 23 gw by 2012 as can be seen from the graph virtually no new wind power has been installed from 2012 to 2015

annual electricity generation from hydroelectric sources varies considerably from year to year a rough calculation shows that the contribution to total net generation varied approximately between 9-17 percent annually this variation helps explain the fluctuating annual figures for total renewable energy in spain production in 2012 was a little over half that of 2010 at just 24100 gwh

growth in installed capacity
in 2005 spain became the first country in europe to require the installation of photovoltaic electricity generation in new buildings and the second in the world after israel to require the installation of solar hot water systems with the construction of the ps10 located near seville spain became the first country to ever have a commercial solar energy power tower in recent years there has been much controversy over a tax on pv power generation as the cost of pv solar installations has reached grid parity in spain according to several sources solar power first began to be installed significantly in 2006 with 136 mw installed capacity before rising rapidly to 6949 mw by 2013 little change has occurred in installed capacity between 2013 and 2015
growth in installed capacity
renewable thermal installed capacity grew from 574 mw in 2006 to 989 mw by 2014

the following two tables show a snapshot of the generation of electricity from renewable sources in spain at the end of 2006 and the end of 2013 in 2006 two regions were generating around 70 percent of electricity demand from renewables by 2013 four regions were generating more electricity from renewables than the total demand within each region the leading region was castile and le√≥n which generated 164 percent of its total electricity demand
