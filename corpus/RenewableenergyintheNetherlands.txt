despite the historic usage of wind power to drain water and grind grain the netherlands lags behind most eu countries in the production of energy from renewable sources the flat and often sub-sea level landscape limits hydropower resources and the country does not lie in a region of high geothermal potential the leading renewable power sources are biomass wind solar and geothermal in 2010 the netherlands produced only 3.7% up from only 1% in 1990
three hydropower plants provide almost all of the netherlands' hydropower in 2010 the netherlands had 1973 wind turbines including 98 in two offshore windfarms the turbines had a total nameplate capacity of 2237 mw flevoland was the leading province for wind energy with groningen second in capacity and production the netherlands had 88 mw of solar electricity and 98 mw of manure digesters in 2010
in 2009 the netherlands used 39% wind power of electricity 278 7073  the wind capacity installed at end 2010 will in a normal wind year produce 4.1% of electricity when the equivalent value for germany is 9.4% and portugal 14%
in the netherlands household consumers can choose to buy renewable electricity for 2008 the amount of renewable energy used by household users is increasing halfway through 2010 it was 44% up from 38% in 2008 and 41% in 2009 a large part of the renewable electricity sold in the netherlands comes from norway a country which generates almost all its electricity with hydropower plants
