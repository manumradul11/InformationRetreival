a research design is the document of the study the design of a study defines the study type descriptive correlational semi-experimental experimental review meta-analytic and sub-type eg descriptive-longitudinal case study research question hypotheses independent and dependent variables experimental design and if applicable data collection methods and a statistical analysis plan research design is the framework that has been created to seek answers to research questions


there are many ways to classify research designs but sometimes the distinction is artificial and other times different designs are combined nonetheless the list below offers a number of useful distinctions between possible research designs
sometimes a distinction is made between fixed and flexible or synonymously quantitative and qualitative research designs however fixed designs need not be quantitative and flexible design need not be qualitative in fixed designs the design of the study is fixed before the main stage of data collection takes place fixed designs are normally theory driven otherwise it is impossible to know in advance which variables need to be controlled and measured often these variables are measured quantitatively flexible designs allow for more freedom during the data collection process one reason for using a flexible research design can be that the variable of interest is not quantitatively measurable such as culture in other cases theory might not be available before one starts the research
the choice of how to group participants depends on the research hypothesis and on how the participants are sampled in a typical experimental study there will be at least one experimental condition eg treatment and one control condition no treatment but the appropriate method of grouping may depend on factors such as the duration of measurement phase and participant characteristics
confirmatory research tests a priori hypotheses—outcome predictions that are made before the measurement phase begins such a priori hypotheses are usually derived from a theory or the results of previous studies the advantage of confirmatory research is that the result is more meaningful in the sense that it is much harder to claim that a certain result is statistically significant the reason for this is that in confirmatory research one ideally strives to reduce the probability of falsely reporting a non-significant result as significant this probability is known as α-level or a type i error loosely speaking if you know what you are looking for you should be very confident when and where you will find it accordingly you only accept a result as significant if it is highly unlikely to have been observed by chance
exploratory research on the other hand seeks to generate a posteriori hypotheses by examining a data-set and looking for potential relations between variables it is also possible to have an idea about a relation between variables but to lack knowledge of the direction and strength of the relation if the researcher does not have any specific hypotheses beforehand the study is exploratory with respect to the variables in question although it might be confirmatory for others the advantage of exploratory research is that it is easier to make new discoveries due to the less stringent methodological restrictions here the researcher does not want to miss a potentially interesting relation and therefore aims to minimize the probability of rejecting a real effect or relation this probability is sometimes referred to as β and the associated error is of type ii in other words if you want to see whether some of your measured variables could be related you would want to increase your chances of finding a significant result by lowering the threshold of what you deem to be significant
sometimes a researcher may conduct exploratory research but report it as if it had been confirmatory 'hypothesizing after the results are known' harking this is a questionable research practice bordering fraud
a distinction can be made between state problems and process problems state problems aim to answer what the state of a phenomenon is at a given time while process problems deal with the change of phenomena over time examples of state problems are the level of mathematical skills of sixteen-year-old children or the level computer skills of the elderly the depression level of a person etc examples of process problems are the development of mathematical skills from puberty to adulthood the change in computer skills when people get older and how depression symptoms change during therapy
state problems are easier to measure than process problems state problems just require one measurement of the phenomena of interest while process problems always require multiple measurements research designs like repeated measures and longitudinal study are needed to address process problems
in an experimental design the researcher actively tries to change the situation circumstances or experience of participants manipulation which may lead to a change in behavior or outcomes for the participants of the study the researcher randomly assigns participants to different conditions measures the variables of interest and tries to control for confounding variables therefore experiments are often highly fixed even before the data collection starts
in a good experimental design a few things are of great importance first of all it is necessary to think of the best way to operationalize the variables that will be measured therefore it is important to consider how the variables will be measured as well as which methods would be most appropriate to answer the research question in addition the statistical analysis has to be taken into account thus the researcher should consider what the expectations of the study are as well as how to analyse this outcome finally in an experimental design the researcher must think of the practical limitations including the availability of participants as well as how representative the participants are to the target population it is important to consider each of these factors before beginning the experiment additionally many researchers employ power analysis before they conduct an experiment in order to determine how large the sample must be to find an effect of a given size with a given design at the desired probability of making a type i or type ii error

non-experimental research designs do not involve a manipulation of the situation circumstances or experience of the participants non-experimental research designs can be broadly classified into three categories first relational designs in which a range of variables is measured these designs are also called correlational studies because correlational data are most often used in analysis it is important to clarify here that correlation does not imply causation and rather identifies dependence of one variable on another correlational designs are helpful in identifying the relation of one variable to another and seeing the frequency of co-occurrence in two natural groups see correlation and dependence the second type is comparative research these designs compare two or more groups on one or more variable such as the effect of gender on grades the third type of non-experimental research is a longitudinal design a longitudinal design examines variables such as performance exhibited by a group or groups over time see longitudinal study
famous case studies are for example the descriptions about the patients of freud who were thoroughly analysed and described
bell 1999 states a case study approach is particularly appropriate for individual researchers because it gives an opportunity for one aspect of a problem to be studied in some depth within a limited time scale
this type of research is involved with a group organization culture or community normally the researcher shares a lot of time with the group
grounded theory research is a systematic research process that works to develop a process and action or an interaction about a substantive topic
