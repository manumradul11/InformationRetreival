responsive web design rwd is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing panning and scrolling—across a wide range of devices from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones
a site designed with rwd adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid proportion-based grids flexible images and css3 media queries an extension of the @media rule in the following ways
responsive web design is becoming more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic this trend is so prevalent that google has begun to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device this has the net effect of penalizing sites that are not mobile friendly


mobile first unobtrusive javascript and progressive enhancement are related concepts that predate rwd  browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand javascript or media queries so a recommended practice is to create a basic web site and enhance it for smart phones and pcs rather than rely on graceful degradation to make a complex image-heavy site work on mobile phones
where a web site must support basic mobile devices that lack javascript browser user agent detection also called browser sniffing and mobile device detection are two ways of deducing if certain html and css features are supported as a basis for progressive enhancement—however these methods are not completely reliable unless used in conjunction with a device capabilities database
for more capable mobile phones and pcs javascript frameworks like modernizr jquery and jquery mobile that can directly test browser support for htmlcss features or identify the device or user agent are popular polyfills can be used to add support for features—eg to support media queries required for rwd and enhance html5 support on internet explorer feature detection also might not be completely reliable some may report that a feature is available when it is either missing or so poorly implemented that it is effectively nonfunctional
luke wroblewski has summarized some of the rwd and mobile design challenges and created a catalog of multi-device layout patterns he suggests that compared with a simple rwd approach device experience or ress responsive web design with server-side components approaches can provide a user experience that is better optimized for mobile devices server-side dynamic css implementation of stylesheet languages like sass or incentivated's mml can be part of such an approach by accessing a server based api which handles the device typically mobile handset differences in conjunction with a device capabilities database in order to improve usability ress is more expensive to develop requiring more than just client-side logic and so tends to be reserved for organizations with larger budgets google recommends responsive design for smartphone websites over other approaches
although many publishers are starting to implement responsive designs one ongoing challenge for rwd is that some banner advertisements and videos are not fluid however search advertising and banner display advertising support specific device platform targeting and different advertisement size formats for desktop smartphone and basic mobile devices different landing page urls can be used for different platforms or ajax can be used to display different advertisement variants on a page css tables permit hybrid fixed+fluid layouts
there are now many ways of validating and testing rwd designs ranging from mobile site validators and mobile emulators to simultaneous testing tools like adobe edge inspect the firefox browser and the chrome console offer responsive design viewport resizing tools as do third parties
the first site to feature a layout that adapts to browser viewport width was audicom launched in late 2001 created by a team at razorfish consisting of jürgen spangl and jim kalbach information architecture ken olling design and jan hoffmann interface development limited browser capabilities meant that for internet explorer the layout could adapt dynamically in the browser whereas for netscape the page had to be reloaded from the server when resized
cameron adams created a demonstration in 2004 that is still online by 2008 a number of related terms such as flexible liquid fluid and elastic were being used to describe layouts css3 media queries were almost ready for prime time in late 2008early 2009 ethan marcotte coined the term responsive web design rwd—and defined it to mean fluid grid flexible images media queries—in a may 2010 article in a list apart he described the theory and practice of responsive web design in his brief 2011 book titled responsive web design responsive design was listed as #2 in top web design trends for 2012 by net magazine after progressive enhancement at #1
mashable called 2013 the year of responsive web design many other sources have recommended responsive design as a cost-effective alternative to mobile applications
