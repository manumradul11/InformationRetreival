in safe-life design products are designed to survive a specific design life with a chosen reserve
safe life is particularly relevant to metal aircraft where airframe components are subjected to varying loads over the lifetime of the aircraft which makes them susceptible to metal fatigue in certain areas such as in wing or tail components structural failure in flight would be catastrophic
the safe-life design technique is employed in critical systems which are either very difficult to repair or may cause severe damage to life and property these systems are designed to work for years without requirement of any repairs
the drawback is that products designed with a safe-life approach are over-built or allocated more resources than they are expected to need which may be uneconomical in order to maintain the designed safety they will have to be replaced after the design life has expired while they may still have a considerable life ahead of them to counter these drawbacks alternative design philosophies like fail-safe design and fault-tolerant design were developed
