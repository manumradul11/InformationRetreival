slinky is a toy a precompressed helical spring invented by richard james in the early 1940s it can perform a number of tricks including travelling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum or appear to levitate for a period of time after it has been dropped these interesting characteristics have contributed to its success as a toy in its home country of usa resulting in many popular toys with slinky components in a wide range of countries


the toy was invented and developed by naval engineer richard t james in 1943 and demonstrated at gimbels department store in philadelphia in november 1945 the toy was a hit selling its entire inventory of 400 units in ninety minutes james and his wife betty formed james industries in clifton heights pennsylvania to manufacture slinky and several related toys such as the slinky dog and suzie the slinky worm in 1960 james' wife betty became president of james industries and in 1964 moved the operation to hollidaysburg pennsylvania in 1998 betty james sold the company to poof products inc
slinky was originally priced at $1 but many paid much more due to price increases of spring steel throughout the state of pennsylvania and has remained modestly priced throughout its history as a result of betty james' concern about the toy's affordability for financially disadvantaged customers slinky has seen uses other than as a toy in the playroom it has appeared in the classroom as a teaching tool in wartime as a radio antenna and in physics experiments with nasa slinky was inducted into the national toy hall of fame at the strong in rochester new york in 2000 in 2002 slinky became pennsylvania's official state toy and in 2003 was named to the toy industry association's century of toys list in its first 60 years slinky has sold 300 million unitscitation needed
in 1943 richard james a naval mechanical engineer stationed at the william cramp and sons shipyards in philadelphia was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas james accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf and watched as the spring stepped in a series of arcs to a stack of books to a tabletop and to the floor where it re-coiled itself and stood upright james' wife betty later recalled he came home and said 'i think if i got the right property of steel and the right tension i could make it walk' james experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year and finally found a spring that would walk betty was dubious at first but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it she dubbed the toy slinky meaning sleek and graceful after finding the word in a dictionary and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing
with a us$500 loan the couple formed james industries originally james spring & wire company had 400 slinky units made by a local machine shop hand-wrapped each in yellow paper and priced them at $1 a piece each was 21‚ÅÑ2 tall and included 98 coils of high-grade blue-black swedish steel the jameses had difficulty selling slinky to toy stores but in november 1945 they were granted permission to set up an inclined plane in the toy section of gimbels department store in philadelphia to demonstrate the toy slinky was a hit and the first 400 units were sold within ninety minutes in 1946 slinky was introduced at the american toy fair
richard james opened shop in albany new york after developing a machine that could produce a slinky within seconds the toy was packaged in a black-lettered box and advertising saturated america james often appeared on television shows to promote slinky in 1952 the slinky dog debuted other slinky toys introduced in the 1950s included the slinky train loco the slinky worm suzie and the slinky crazy eyes a pair of glasses that uses slinkys over the eyeholes attached to plastic eyeballs james industries licensed the patent to several other manufacturers including wilkening mfg co of philadelphia and toronto which produced spring-centered toys such as mr wiggle's leap frog and mr wiggle's cowboy in its first 2 years james industries sold 100 million slinkys at $1 apiece that would be the equivalent to $1 billion adjusted for inflation in gross revenue over those 2 years
in 1960 richard james left the company after his wife filed for divorce and he became an evangelical missionary in bolivia with wycliffe bible translators betty james managed the company juggled creditors and in 1964 moved the company to hollidaysburg pennsylvania richard james died in 1974 the company and its product line expanded under betty james' leadership in 1995 she explained the toy's success to the associated press by saying it's the simplicity of it
betty james insisted upon keeping the original slinky affordable in 1996 when the price ranged from $1.89 to $2.69 she told the new york times so many children can't have expensive toys and i feel a real obligation to them i'm appalled when i go christmas shopping and $60 to $80 for a toy is nothing in 2008 slinkys cost $4 to $5 and slinky dogs about $20
in 1998 james industries was sold to poof products inc of plymouth michigan a manufacturer of foam sports balls slinky continued production in hollidaysburg in 2003 james industries merged with poof products inc to create poof-slinky inc
betty james died of congestive heart failure in november 2008 aged 90 after having served as president of james industries from 1960 to 1998 over 300 million slinkys have been sold between 1945 and 2005 and the original slinky is still a bestseller
the rules that govern the mechanics of a slinky are due to hooke's law and the effects of gravitation
due to simple harmonic motion the period of oscillation of a dangling slinky is
where t is the time of the period of oscillation m is the mass of the slinky and k is the spring constant of the slinky
in the state of equilibrium of a slinky all net force is cancelled throughout the entire slinky this results in a stationary slinky with zero velocity as the positions of each part of the slinky is governed by the slinky's mass the force of gravity and the spring constant various other properties of the slinky may be induced the length of a perfect slinky with zero length when extended is
where l is the length of the slinky w is the weight of the slinky and k is the spring constant of the slinky
due to the forces of gravity the slinky appears bunched up towards the bottom end as the function of the position of a slinky is
where n is the dimensionless variable ranging from 0 to 1 0 being the top and 1 being the bottom of the slinky and each number between is the percentage of the slinky's mass above point n and pn gives the position that n is above the bottom of the slinky
this quadratic equation means that rather than the center of mass being at the middle of the slinky it lies one quarter of the length above the bottom end
when set in motion on a stepped platform such as a stairway the slinky transfers energy along its length in a longitudinal wave the whole spring descends end over end in a periodical motion as if it were somersaulting down one step at a time
when any slinky is shortened by means of cutting the slinky or simply by holding a large portion of the top the result is a stronger spring strength through observation of the length and position equations this becomes apparent because by removing three quarters the length only half the mass is removed the result is a spring constant twice as high as the original strength and the effects can be easily observed through the effects on the period of oscillation
when the top end of the slinky is dropped the information of the tension change must propagate to the bottom end before both sides begin to fall the top of an extended slinky will drop while the bottom initially remains in its original position compressing the spring this creates a suspension time of 0.3 s for an original slinky but has potential to create a much larger suspension time
the famous jingle for the slinky television commercial was created in columbia south carolina in 1962 with johnny mccullough and homer fesperman writing the music and charles weagly penning the lyrics it became the longest-running jingle in advertising history
the jingle has itself been parodied and referenced in popular culture it is seen in the log commercial on the ren & stimpy show and sung by actor jim carrey in ace ventura when nature calls the song is also referenced in the movie lords of dogtown where it is sung in full by emile hirsch and is sung by eddie murphy as part of the final routine in the stand-up comedy film eddie murphy raw
early in the history of james industries helen herrick malsed of the state of washington sent the company a letter and drawings for developing slinky pull-toys the company liked her ideas and slinky dog and slinky train were added to the company's product line slinky dog a small plastic dog whose front and rear ends were joined by a metal slinky debuted in 1952 malsed received royalties of $60000 to $70000 annually for 17 years on her patent for the slinky pull-toy idea but never visited the plant
in 1995 the slinky dog was redesigned for all of pixar's toy story james industries had discontinued their slinky dog a few years previously betty james approved of the new slinky dog telling the press the earlier slinky dog wasn't nearly as cute as this one the molds used in manufacturing the new toy created problems for james industries so the plastic front and rear ends were manufactured in china with james industries doing the assembly and packaging the entire run of 825000 redesigned slinky dogs sold out well before christmas 1995
plastic slinkys are also available they can be made in different colors many of them are made with the colors of the rainbow in rainbow order they were marketed in the 1970s as a safer alternative to metal slinkys as they did not present a hazard when inserted into electrical sockets the plastic spring toy known as the plastic slinky was invented by donald james reum sr of master mark plastics in albany minnesota mr reum came up with the idea as he was playing with different techniques to produce a spiral hose for watering plants however as it came off the assembly line according to his children it looked more like a slinky he worked at it until it came out perfectly and then went to betty james with his prototype mr reum manufactured the plastic slinky for betty james for several years eventually betty james decided to manufacture the product exclusively through james manufacturing effectively ending the production of the toy by the small minnesota company reum's patent number 4120929 was filed on dec 28 1976 and issued by the us patent office on oct 17 1978
in 1999 the united states postal service issued a slinky postage stamp the slinky was inducted into the toy hall of fame in 2000 in their celebrate the century stamp series a bill to nominate the slinky as the state toy of pennsylvania was introduced by richard geist in 2001 but not enacted the same year betty james was inducted into the toy industry association's hall of fame in 2003 slinky was named to the toy industry association's century of toys list a roll call of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the twentieth century
high school teachers and college professors have used slinkys to simulate the properties of waves united states troops in the vietnam war used them as mobile radio antennasverification neededas have amateur radio operators and nasa has used them in zero-gravity physics experiments in the space shuttle
slinkys and similar springs can be used to create a 'laser gun' like sound effect this is done by holding up a slinky in the air and striking one end resulting in a metallic tone which sharply lowers in pitch this is due to the properties of the metal higher frequencies travel faster than the lower ones so as to the listener the high-pitched sound is heard first then gets progressively lowercitation needed the effect can be amplified by attaching a plastic cup to one end of the slinky
in 1959 john cage composed an avant garde work called sounds of venice scored for among other things a piano a slab of marble and venetian broom a birdcage of canaries and an amplified slinky
in 1985 in conjunction with the johnson space center and the houston museum of natural science discovery astronauts created a video demonstrating how familiar toys behave in space it won't slink at all dr m rhea seddon said of slinky it sort of droops the video was prepared to stimulate interest in school children about the basic principles of physics and the phenomenon of weightlessness
in 1992 the bishop museum in honolulu hawaii hosted an interactive traveling exhibit developed by the franklin institute of philadelphia called what makes music? among other things visitors could examine what makes musical sound by creating waves on an eight-foot-long version of a slinky toy
