social design is design that is mindful of the designer’s role and responsibility in society and the use of the design process to bring about social change


within the design world social design is sometimes defined as a design process that contributes to improving human well-being and livelihood the agenda of social design is inspired by among others' victor papanek’s idea that designers and creative professionals have a responsibility and are able to cause real change in the world through good design papanek writes about responsible design designers can contribute to designing more ecological products by carefully selecting the materials they use papanek also remarks on designing for people's needs rather than their wants responsible design includes many directions and one of these is design for the third world designers have responsibility over the choices they make in design processes
social design thinking within the design world joins developing human and social capital with new products and processes that are profitable profitability and ownership of the processes are the cornerstones of sustainability that underpins human well-being another author that contributes to the development of this definition of social design is victor margolin he writes in the politics of the artificial about the designer's ability to envision and give form on material and immaterial products that can address human problems on broad scale and contribute to social well-being this ideology is something that social design is built on in this view social design is an activity that should not be framed with connotations of charity aid donations help etc it is not voluntary work but it should be seen as professional contribution that plays a part in local economic development or livelihood
another starting point for outlining social design is strategic thinking of design creating policies and implementing them on a civil level the two poles tradition and the market economy can in one of the models for social design be placed in interaction rather than in competition with each other an author that has to be mentioned here is jacque fresco and his venus project he proposes that the future of the social systems needs to be designed by the scientific method social design can then be seen as a process that leads to human capabilities that in turn contributes to their well-being as amartya sen writes poverty is seen as deprivation of capabilities by focusing on capabilities rather than eg income amartya sen suggests that development within various social aspects of life can contribute to general development understanding and using social design processes can contribute to the improvement of livelihood
as social media becomes integrated with live performance social design has become a term to describe someone who designs how online tools connect to a performance just as there are lighting designers sound designers set designers costume designers and video designers - social designers work with a team to complement a production with social media tools and content in this context social design is defined as the strategic implementation of social media to deepen or broaden the nature of an artistic performance
another dimension of social design focuses on designing systems that join the elements of communication new product development and the environment it is argued that no single area of design is by itself sufficient to drive sustainable social development what is needed is a system of design one that encompasses all of the areas of design towards an open system with multiple self-adjusting and complementary actors that aim for a vision of a loosely defined common set of goals
outside the design world social design appears in a number of professional environments there are a growing number of artists especially in scandinavia that use the term social design to describe their work though the work is exhibited within the art world these are artist like fos and superflex they come out of a tradition of social art that can be led back to the futurists the dadaists and eg the german artist joseph beuys
the term social design is also increasingly used to describe design of the social world this definition implicates a perception of a man-made reality which consequently can only be changed by man and is changed by man all the time in this view social design is inescapable it is there whether people are aware of it or not the social reality is created as a result of the sum of all our individual actions there is an emerging discussion of this concept of social design which encompasses all other definitions of the term
