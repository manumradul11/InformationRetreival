soft energy technologies may be seen as appropriate renewable technologies soft energy technologies are not simply renewable energy technologies as there are many renewable energy technologies which are not regarded as soft


more specifically soft energy technologies have five defining characteristics they rely on renewable energy resources are diverse and designed for maximum effectiveness in particular circumstances are flexible and relatively simple to understand are matched to end-use needs in terms of scale and are matched to end-use needs in terms of quality an energy technology must satisfy all five of these criteria to be soft
residential solar energy technologies are prime examples of soft energy technologies and rapid deployment of simple energy conserving residential solar energy technologies is fundamental to a soft energy strategy active residential solar technologies use special devices to collect and convert the sun's rays to useful energy and are located near the users they supply passive residential solar technologies passive house involve the natural transfer by radiation convection and conduction of solar energy without the use of mechanical devices
the term soft is not meant to be vague speculative or ephemeral but rather sustainable flexible resilient and benign soft technology impacts are generally seen to be more gentle pleasant and manageable than high technology impacts these impacts range from the individual and household level to those affecting the very fabric of society at the national and international level more specifically favourable socio-political impacts include
the use of soft energy technologies in conjunction with energy efficiency and the transitional use of fossil fuel technology go to comprise the soft energy path
