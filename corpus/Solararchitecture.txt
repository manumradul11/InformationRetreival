solar architecture is the integration of passive solar active solar or solar panel technology with modern building techniques the use of flexible thin-film photovoltaic modules provides fluid integration with steel roofing profiles enhancing the building's design orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air also constitute solar architecture
initial development of solar architecture has been limited by the rigidity and weight of standard solar power panels the continued development of photovoltaic pv thin film solar has provided a lightweight yet robust vehicle to harness solar energy to reduce a building's impact on the environment


the idea of passive solar building design first appeared in greece around the fifth century bc up until that time the greek's main source of fuel was charcoal but due to a major shortage of wood to burn they were forced to find a new way of heating their dwellings with necessity as their motivation the greeks revolutionized the design of their cities they began using building materials that absorbed solar energy mostly stone and also started orienting the buildings so that they faced south these revolutions coupled with an overhang that kept out the hot summer sun created structures which required very little heating and cooling socrates wrote in houses that look toward the south the sun penetrates the portico in winter while in summer the path of the sun is right over our heads and above the roof so that there is shade from this point on most civilizations have oriented their structures to provide shade in the summer and heating in the winter the romans improved on the greek's design by covering the southern facing windows with different types of transparent materials another simpler example of early solar architecture is the cave dwellings in the south-western regions of north america much like the greek and roman buildings the cliffs in which the indigenous people of this region built their homes were oriented towards the south with an overhang to shade them from the midday sun during the summer months and capture as much of the solar energy during the winter as possible
active solar architecture involves the moving of heat andor coolness between a temporary heat storage medium and a building typically in response to a thermostat's call for heat or coolness within the building while this principle sounds useful in theory significant engineering problems have thwarted almost all active solar architecture in practice the most common form of active solar architecture rock bed storage with air as a heat transfer medium usually grew toxic mold in the rock bed which was blown into houses along with dust and radon in some cases
a more complex and modern incarnation of solar architecture was introduced in 1954 with the invention of the photovoltaic cell by bell labs early cells were extremely inefficient and therefore not widely used but throughout the years government and private research has improved the efficiency to a point where it is now a viable source of energy universities were some of the first buildings to embrace the idea of solar energy in 1973 the university of delaware built solar one which was one of the world’s first solar powered houses as photovoltaic technologies keep advancing solar architecture becomes easier to accomplish in 1998 subhendu guha developed photovoltaic shingles and recently a company called oxford photovoltaics has developed perovskite solar cells that are thin enough to incorporate into windows although the windows are not scaled to a size that can be taken advantage of on a commercial level yet the company believes that the outlook is very promising in the company’s mission statement they state moreover through the deployment of solar cells in areas where solar has traditionally struggled for example the glass façades of high-rise commercial or residential buildings in both cases allowing solar energy to contribute a much higher proportion of electricity than is possible today and helping to position pv as a significant factor in the global energy market
one of the first large commercial buildings to exemplify solar architecture is 4 times square also known as the condé nast building in new york city it has built-in solar panels on the 37th through the 43rd floors and incorporated more energy efficient technology than any other sky scraper at the time of its construction the national stadium in kaohsiung taiwan designed by the world-famous japanese architect toyo ito is a dragon-shaped structure that has 8844 solar panels on its roofcitation needed it was built in 2009 to house the 2009 world games constructed completely of recycled materials it is the largest solar-powered stadium in the world and powers the surrounding neighborhood when it is not in use another example of solar architecture is the sundial building in china it was built to symbolize the need for replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources the building is shaped like a fan and is covered in 4600 square metres 50000 sq ft of solar panels it was named the world's largest solar powered office building in 2009
although it is not yet completed the solar city tower in rio de janeiro is another example of what solar architecture might look like in the future it is a power plant that generates energy for the city during the day while also pumping water to the top of the structure at night when the sun is not shining the water will be released to run over turbines that will continue to generate electricity it is set to be revealed at the 2016 olympic games in rio although the project is still in the proposal phase a lot of conferences discuss this topic as green urbanism an international conference which will be held in italy from 12-14 october 2016 
according to an article on ecn's website titled architects just want to develop attractive buildings an architect's main purpose is to create a spatial object with lines shapes colours and texture these are the challenges for the architect within the customer's programme of requirements but they do not immediately think of using a solar panel as an interesting building material there is still much to be achieved here in the article it is stated multiple times that solar panels are not an architect's first choice for building material because of their cost and aesthetics
another criticism of installing solar panels is their upfront cost according to energyinfomativeorg the average cost for a residential solar system is somewhere between $15000 and $40000 usd and about $7 per watt in the article it says that at today's rates it would take ten years to pay off an average system
