a solar cooker is a device which uses the energy of direct sunlight to heat cook or pasteurize food or drink many solar cookers presently in use are relatively inexpensive low-tech devices although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves and advanced large-scale solar cookers can cook for hundreds of people because they use no fuel and cost nothing to operate many nonprofit organizations are promoting their use worldwide in order to help reduce fuel costs especially where monetary reciprocity is low and air pollution and to slow down the deforestation and desertification caused by gathering firewood for cooking solar cooking is a form of outdoor cooking and is often used in situations where minimal fuel consumption is important or the danger of accidental fires is high and the health and environmental consequences of alternatives are severe
many types of solar cookers exist including curved concentrator solar cookers solar ovens and panel cookers among others


1 concentrating sunlight a mirrored surface with high specular reflectivity is used to concentrate light from the sun onto a small cooking area depending on the geometry of the surface sunlight can be concentrated by several orders of magnitude producing temperatures high enough to melt salt and smelt metal for most household solar cooking applications such high temperatures are not really required solar cooking products thus are typically designed to achieve temperatures of 150 °f 65 °c baking temperatures to 750 °f 400 °c grillingsearing temperatures on a sunny day
2 converting light energy to heat energy solar cookers concentrate sunlight onto a receiver such as a cooking pan the interaction between the light energy and the receiver material converts light to heat this conversion is maximized by using materials that conduct and retain heat pots and pans used on solar cookers should be matte black in color to maximize the absorption
3 trapping heat energy it is important to reduce convection by isolating the air inside the cooker from the air outside the cooker simply using a glass lid on your pot enhances light absorption from the top of the pan and provides a greenhouse effect that improves heat retention and minimizes convection loss this glazing transmits incoming visible sunlight but is opaque to escaping infrared thermal radiation in resource constrained settings a high-temperature plastic bag can serve a similar function trapping air inside and making it possible to reach temperatures on cold and windy days similar to those possible on hot days
different kinds of solar cookers use somewhat different methods of cooking but most follow the same basic principles
food is prepared as if for an oven or stove top however because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be for example potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole for very simple cooking such as melting butter or cheese a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl if several foods are to be cooked separately then they are placed in different containers
the container of food is placed inside the solar cooker which may be elevated on a brick rock metal trivet or other heat sink and the solar cooker is placed in direct sunlight if the solar cooker is entirely in direct sunlight then the shadow of the solar cooker will not overlap with the shadow of any nearby object foods that cook quickly may be added to the solar cooker later rice for a mid-day meal might be started early in the morning with vegetables cheese or soup added to the solar cooker in the middle of the morning depending on the size of the solar cooker and the number and quantity of cooked foods a family may use one or more solar cookers
a solar oven is turned towards the sun and left until the food is cooked unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire which may require more than an hour of constant supervision food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the trapped heat to escape and thereby slows the cooking process if wanted the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours to turn the oven to face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight if the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day then the solar oven is often turned to face the point where the sun will be when it is highest in the sky instead of towards its current position
the cooking time depends primarily on the equipment being used the amount of sunlight at the time and the quantity of food that needs to be cooked air temperature wind and latitude also affect performance food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon large quantities of food and food in large pieces take longer to cook as a result only general figures can be given for cooking time with a small solar panel cooker it might be possible to melt butter in 15 minutes to bake cookies in 2 hours and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours with a high performing parabolic solar cooker you may be able to grill a steak in minutes however depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type these projects could take half as long or twice as long
it is difficult to burn food in a solar cooker food that has been cooked even an hour longer than necessary is usually indistinguishable from minimally cooked food the exception to this rule is some green vegetables which quickly change from a perfectly cooked bright green to olive drab while still retaining the desirable texture
for most foods such as rice the typical person would be unable to tell how it was cooked from looking at the final product there are some differences however bread and cakes brown on their tops instead of on the bottom compared to cooking over a fire the food does not have a smoky flavor
a box cooker has a transparent glass or plastic top and it may have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box the top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside one or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom which is in contact with the pots the box should have insulated sides thermal insulation for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150 °c 300 °f without melting or out-gassing crumpled newspaper wool rags dry grass sheets of cardboard etc can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker metal pots andor bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint one that is non-toxic when warmed black tempera paint or soot from a fire the solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150 °c 300 °f this is not as hot as a standard oven but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time
panel solar cookers are inexpensive solar cookers that use reflective panels to direct sunlight to a cooking pot that is enclosed in a clear plastic bag
solar oven science experiments are regularly done as projects in high schools and colleges such as the solar oven throwdown at the university of arizona these projects prove that it is possible to both achieve high temperatures as well as predict the high temperatures using mathematical models
parabolic solar cookers concentrate sunlight to a single point when this point is focused on the bottom of a pot it can heat the pot quickly to very high temperatures which can often be comparable with the temperatures achieved in gas and charcoal grills these types of solar cookers are widely used in several regions of the world most notably in china and india where hundreds of thousands of families currently use parabolic solar cookers for preparing food and heating water some parabolic solar cooker projects in china abate between 1-4 tons of carbon dioxide per year and receive carbon credits through the clean development mechanism cdm and gold standard
some parabolic solar cookers incorporate cutting edge materials and designs which lead to solar energy efficiencies >90% such as the solsource developed by one earth designs others are large enough to feed thousands of people each day such as the solar bowl at auroville in india which makes 2 meals per day for 1000 people
if a reflector is axially symmetrical and shaped so its cross-section is a parabola it has the property of bringing parallel rays of light such as sunlight to a point focus if the axis of symmetry is aimed at the sun any object that is located at the focus receives highly concentrated sunlight and therefore becomes very hot this is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for solar cooking
paraboloids are compound curves which are more difficult to make with simple equipment than single curves although paraboloidal solar cookers can cook as well as or better than a conventional stove they are difficult to construct by hand frequently these reflectors are made using many small segments that are all single curves which together approximate compound curves
although paraboloids are difficult to make from flat sheets of solid material they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids the top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally takes the form of a paraboloid centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity it turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid if the material solidifies while it is rotating the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops and can be used to make a reflectorcitation needed this rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes and has also been used for solar cookers devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces
paraboloidal reflectors generate high temperatures and cook quickly but require frequent adjustment and supervision for safe operation several hundred thousand exist mainly in chinacitation needed they are especially useful for individual household and large-scale institutional cooking
a scheffler cooker named after its inventor wolfgang scheffler uses a large ideally paraboloidal reflector which is rotated around an axis that is parallel with the earth's using a mechanical mechanism turning at 15 degrees per hour to compensate for the earth's rotation the axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass allowing the reflector to be turned easily the cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day the mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's declination this perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel therefore if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts to keep the focus stationary the reflector's shape has to vary it remains paraboloidal but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts the scheffler reflector is therefore flexible and can be bent to adjust its shape it is often made up of a large number of small plane sections such as glass mirrors joined together by flexible plastic a framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately the mirror is never exactly paraboloidal but it is always close enough for cooking purposescitation needed
sometimes the rotating reflector is located outdoors and the reflected sunlight passes through an opening in a wall into an indoor kitchen often a large communal one where the cooking is donecitation needed
paraboloidal reflectors that have their centres of mass coincident with their focal points are useful they can be easily turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky rotating about any axis that passes through the focus two perpendicular axes can be used intersecting at the focus to allow the paraboloid to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one the cooking pot stays stationary at the focus if the paraboloidal reflector is axially symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness its centre of mass coincides with its focus if the depth of the reflector measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim is 1.8478 times its focal length the radius of the rim of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length the angular radius of the rim as seen from the focal point is 72.68 degreescitation needed
parabolic troughs are used to concentrate sunlight for solar-energy purposes some solar cookers have been built that use them in the same waycitation needed generally the trough is aligned with its focal line horizontal and east-west the food to be cooked is arranged along this line the trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon this requires the trough to be tilted up and down as the seasons progress at the equinoxes no movement of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun at other times of year there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed usually the cooker is used only during this period so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it this simplicity makes the design attractive compared with using a paraboloid also being a single curve the trough reflector is simpler to construct however it suffers from lower efficiency
it is possible to use two parabolic troughs curved in perpendicular directions to bring sunlight to a point focus as does a paraboloidal reflectorcitation neededthe incoming light strikes one of the troughs which sends it toward a line focus the second trough intercepts the converging light and focuses it to a pointcitation needed
compared with a single paraboloid using two partial troughs has important advantages each trough is a single curve which can be made simply by bending a flat sheet of metal also the light that reaches the targeted cooking pot is directed approximately downward which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby on the other hand there are disadvantages more mirror material is needed increasing the cost and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one which inevitably increases the amount that is lost
the two troughs are held in a fixed orientation relative to each other by being both fixed to a framecitation needed the whole assembly of frame and troughs has to be moved to track the sun as it moves in the sky commercially made cookers that use this method are available
spherical reflectors operate much like paraboloidal reflectors such that the axis of symmetry is pointed towards the sun so that light is concentrated to a focus however the focus of a spherical reflector will not be a point focus because it suffers from a phenomenon known as spherical aberration some concentrating dishes such as satellite dishes that do not require a precise focus opt for a spherical curvature over a paraboloid if the radius of the rim of spherical reflector is small compared with the radius of curvature of its surface the radius of the sphere of which the reflector is a part the reflector approximates a paraboloidal one with focal length equal to half of the radius of curvature
evacuated tube solar cookers are essentially a vacuum sealed between two layers of glass the vacuum allows the tube to act both as a super greenhouse and an insulator the central cooking tube is made from borosilicate glass which is resistant to thermal shock and has a vacuum beneath the surface to insulate the interior the inside of the tube is lined with copper stainless steel and aluminum nitrile to better absorb and conduct heat from the sun's rays some vacuum tube solar cookers incorporate lightweight designs which allow great portability such as the gosun stove
