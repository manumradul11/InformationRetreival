solar gain also known as solar heat gain or passive solar gain refers to the increase in temperature in a space object or structure that results from solar radiation the amount of solar gain increases with the strength of the sunlight and with the ability of any intervening material to transmit or resist the radiation
objects struck by sunlight absorb the short-wave radiation from the light and reradiate the heat at longer infrared wavelengths certain materials and substances such as glass are more transparent to the shorter wavelengths than the longer when the sun shines through such materials the net result is an increase in temperature — solar gain this effect the greenhouse effect so called due to the solar gain that is experienced behind the glass of a greenhouse has since become well known in the context of global warming


when discussing the properties of windows doors and shading devices shading coefficients are commonly mentioned properties shading coefficients measure the solar energy transmittance through windows
for all practical purposes especially in countries like india or rather within asian zone where there is ample of sunlight & heat available it is better to optimise solar factor ie to orient your glass with high solar factor such that you allow maximum sunlight to enter the interior of the structurehence if used in offices there is absolute no electricity consumption of artificial lights during day time and since they may be offices with huge working area which are closed during night time the structure can count of light efficiency achievement of 100% with reducing the energy consumption of the structure accodinglyhowever for all south zone countries it is recommended not to exceed this value by 0.4 or 40%
g-values and shgc values ranges from 0 to 1 a lower value representing less solar gain shading coefficient values are calculated using the sum of the primary solar transmittance t-value and the secondary transmittance primary transmittance is the fraction of solar radiation that directly enters a building through a window compared to the total solar insolation the amount of radiation that the window receives the secondary transmittance is the fraction of inwardly flowing solar energy absorbed in the window or shading device again compared to the total solar insolation
in cold and mixed climates windows should be designed sized and positioned in order to provide solar heat gains during the heating season to that end glazing should have a relatively high solar heat gains coefficient it should not block solar heat gains as much as possible especially in the sunny side of the house for triple glazing consider a whole-window shgc in the range 0.33 - 0.47 for double glazing consider a shgc in the range 0.42 - 0.55 the higher the better
tuning the type of glass in order to increase or to decrease solar heat is a complex task that should be properly combined with the positioning of the windows the use of shading devices and especially in hot and mixed climates overhangs porches and other architectural elements
in the context of passive solar building design the aim of the designer is normally to maximise solar gain within the building in the winter to reduce space heating demand and to control it in summer to minimise cooling requirements thermal mass may be used to even out the fluctuations during the day and to some extent between days
in direct solar gain systems the composition and coating of the building glazing can also be manipulated to optimise the greenhouse effect while its size position and shading can be used to optimise solar gain solar gain can also be transferred to the building by indirect or isolated solar gain systems
