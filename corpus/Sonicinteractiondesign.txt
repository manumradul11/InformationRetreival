sonic interaction design is the study and exploitation of sound as one of the principal channels conveying information meaning and aestheticemotional qualities in interactive contexts sonic interaction design is at the intersection of interaction design and sound and music computing if interaction design is about designing objects people interact with and such interactions are facilitated by computational means in sonic interaction design sound is mediating interaction either as a display of processes or as an input medium


research in this area focuses on experimental scientific findings about human sound reception in interactive contexts
during closed-loop interactions the users manipulate an interface that produces sound and the sonic feedback affects in turn the users’ manipulation in other words there is a tight coupling between auditory perception and action listening to sounds might not only activate a representation of how the sound was made it might also prepare the listener to react to the sound cognitive representations of sounds might be associated with action-planning schemas and sounds can also unconsciously cue a further reaction on the part of the listener
sonic interactions have the potential to influence the users’ emotions the quality of the sounds affects the pleasantness of the interaction and the difficulty of the manipulation influences whether the user feels in control or not
product design in the context of sonic interaction design is dealing with methods and experiences for designing interactive products having a salient sonic behaviour products in this context are either tangible and functional objects that are designed to be manipulated or usable simulations of such objects as in virtual prototyping research and development in this area relies on studies from other disciplines such as
in design research for sonic products a set of practices have been inherited from a variety of fields such practices have been tested in contexts where research and pedagogy naturally intermix among these practices it suffices to mention
in the context of sonic interaction design interactive art and music projects are designing and researching aesthetic experiences where sonic interaction is in the focus the creative and expressive aspects – the aesthetics – are more important than conveying information through sound practices include installations performances public art and interactions between humans through digitally-augmented objectsenvironments these often integrate elements such as embedded technology gesture-sensitive devices speakers or context-aware systems
the experience is in the focus addressing how humans are affected by the sound and vice versa interactive art and music allows us to question existing paradigms and models of how we interact with technology and sound going beyond paradigms of control human controlling a machine users are part of a loop which includes action and perception
interactive art and music projects invite explorative actions and playful engagement there is also a multi-sensory aspect especially haptic-audio  and audio-visual projects are popular amongst many other influences this field is informed by the development of the roles of instrument-maker composer and performer merging
artistic research in sonic interaction design is about productions in the interactive arts and performing arts exploiting the role of enactive engagement with sound–augmented interactive objects
sonification is the data-dependent generation of sound if the transformation is systematic objective and reproducible so that it can be used as scientific method
for sonic interaction design sonification provides a set of methods to create interaction sounds that encode relevant data so that the user can perceive or interpret the conveyed information sonification does not necessarily need to represent huge amounts of data in sound but may only convey one or few data values in a sound to give an example imagine a light switch that on activation would create a short sound that depends on the electric power consumed through the cable more energy-wasting lamps would perhaps systematically result in more annoying switch sounds this example shows that sonification aims to provide some information by using its systematic transformation into sound
the integration of data-driven elements in interaction sound may serve different purposes
within the field of sonification sonic interaction design acknowledges the importance of human interaction for understanding and using auditory feedback within sonic interaction design sonification can help and offer solutions methods and techniques to inspire and guide the design of products or interactive systems
