sound design is the process of specifying acquiring manipulating or generating audio elements it is employed in a variety of disciplines including filmmaking television production theatre sound recording and reproduction live performance sound art post-production radio and video game software development sound design most commonly involves the manipulation of previously composed or recorded audio such as sound effects and dialogue in some instances it may also involve the composition or manipulation of audio to create a desired effect or mood a sound designer is one who practices the art of sound design


the use of sound to evoke emotion reflect mood and underscore actions in plays and dances began in prehistoric times at its earliest it was used in religious practices for healing or just for fun in ancient japan theatrical events called kagura were performed in shinto shrines with music and dance
plays were performed in medieval times in a form of theatre called commedia dell'arte which used music and sound effects to enhance performances the use of music and sound in the elizabethan theatre followed in which music and sound effects were produced off stage using devices such as bells whistles and horns cues would be written in the script for music and sound effects to be played at the appropriate time
italian composer luigi russolo built mechanical sound-making devices called intonarumori for futurist theatrical and music performances starting around 1913 these devices were meant to simulate natural and man-made sounds such as trains and bombs russolo's treatise the art of noises is one of the earliest written documents on the use of abstract noise in the theatre after his death his intonarumori' were used in more conventional theatre performances to create realistic sound effects
possibly the first use of recorded sound in the theatre was a phonograph playing a baby’s cry in a london theatre in 1890 sixteen years later herbert beerbohm tree used recordings in his london production of stephen phillips’ tragedy nero the event is marked in the theatre magazine 1906 with two photographs one showing a musician blowing a bugle into a large horn attached to a disc recorder the other with an actor recording the agonizing shrieks and groans of the tortured martyrs the article states these sounds are all realistically reproduced by the gramophone as cited by bertolt brecht there was a play about rasputin written in 1927 by alexej tolstoi and directed by erwin piscator that included a recording of lenin's voice whilst the term sound designer was not in use at this time a number of stage managers specialised as effects men creating and performing offstage sound effects using a mix of vocal mimicry mechanical and electrical contraptions and gramophone records a great deal of care and attention was paid to the construction and performance of these effects both naturalistic and abstract over the course of the twentieth century the use of recorded sound effects began to take over from live sound effects though often it was the stage manager's duty to find the sound effects and an electrician played the recordings during performances but even though the sound designer has basically assumed these roles time and technology have not ruled out non-sound designers having a hand in sound production for instance since today's audiences are savvier and can readily distinguish between live and recorded sounds live backstage sound effects are still used eg gunshots by the stage manager or assistant stage manager for premium aural illusion
between 1980 and 1988 charlie richmond usitt's first sound design commissioner oversaw efforts of their sound design commission to define the duties responsibilities standards and procedures which might normally be expected of a theatre sound designer in north america this subject is still regularly discussed by that group but during that time substantial conclusions were drawn and he wrote a document which although now somewhat dated provides a succinct record of what was expected at that time it was subsequently provided to both the adc and david goodman at the florida usa local when they were both planning to represent sound designers in the 1990s
midi and digital audio technology helped to drive the rapid evolution of sound design during the 1980s and 1990s features of computerized theatre sound design systems were recognized as being essential for live show control systems at walt disney world and as a result disney utilized systems of that type to control many facilities at their disney-mgm studios theme park which opened in 1989 these features were incorporated into the midi show control msc specification an open communications protocol used to interact with diverse devices the first show to fully utilize the msc specification was the magic kingdom parade at walt disney world's magic kingdom in september 1991
also the world wide web has greatly enhanced the ability of sound designers to acquire source material quickly easily and cheaply nowadays a designer can preview and download crisper more believable sounds as opposed to toiling through time- and budget-draining shot-in-the-dark searches through record stores libraries and the grapevine for often inferior recordings in addition software innovation has enabled sound designers to take more of a diy or do-it-yourself approach from the comfort of their home and at any hour they can simply use a computer speakers and headphones rather than renting or buying costly equipment or studio space and time for editing and mixing this provides for faster creation and negotiation with the director
in motion picture production a sound designer is a member of a film crew responsible for some original aspect of the film's audio in the american film industry the title of sound designer is not controlled by any industry organization unlike titles such as director or screenwriter
the terms sound design and sound designer were introduced to the film world in 1972 the title of sound designer was first granted to walter murch by francis ford coppola in recognition for murch's extraordinary contributions to the film apocalypse now the original meaning of the title sound designer as established by coppola and murch was an individual ultimately responsible for all aspects of a film's audio track from the dialogue and sound effects recording to the re-recording mix of the final track the position of sound designer emerged in a manner similar to that of production designer which was created in the 1930s when william cameron menzies made revolutionary contributions to the craft of art direction in the making of gone with the wind

the role of sound designer can be compared with the role of supervising sound editor many sound designers use both titles interchangeably the role of supervising sound editor or sound supervisor developed in parallel with the role of sound designer the demand for more sophisticated soundtracks was felt both inside and outside hollywood and the supervising sound editor became the head of the large sound department with a staff of dozens of sound editors that was required to realize a complete sound job with a fast turnaround it is far from universal but the role of sound supervisor descends from the original role of the sound editor that of a technician required to complete a film but having little creative authority sound designers on the other hand are expected to be creative and their status is comparable to the other creative department heads
sound design as a separate discipline is one of the youngest fields in stagecraft second only to the use of projection and other multimedia displays although the ideas and techniques of sound design have been around almost since theatre started dan dugan working with three stereo tape decks routed to ten loudspeaker zones during the 1968–69 season of american conservatory theater act in san francisco was the first person to be called a sound designer
modern audio technology has enabled theatre sound designers to produce flexible complex and inexpensive designs that can be easily integrated into live performance the influence of film and television on playwriting is seeing plays being written increasingly with shorter scenes which is difficult to achieve with scenery but easily conveyed with sound the development of film sound design is giving writers and directors higher expectations and knowledge of sound design consequently theatre sound design is widespread and accomplished sound designers commonly establish long-term collaborations with directors
some sound designers specialize in certain genres of work though typically most work across all genres the two most common specialisms are in musical theatre and plays with others including devised work children's theatre dance and opera
sound design for musicals often focuses on the design and implementation of a sound reinforcement system that will fulfill the needs of the production if a sound system is already installed in the performance venue it is the sound designer's job to tune the system for the best use for a particular production sound system tuning employs various methods including equalization delay volume speaker and microphone placement and in some cases the addition of new equipment in conjunction with the director and musical director if any the sound reinforcement designer determines the use and placement of microphones for actors and musicians the sound reinforcement designer ensures that the performance can be heard and understood by everyone in the audience regardless of the shape size or acoustics of the venue and that performers can hear everything needed to enable them to do their jobs while sound design for a musical largely focuses on the artistic merits of sound reinforcement many musicals such as into the woods also require significant sound scores see sound design for plays sound reinforcement design was recognized by the american theatre wing's tony awards with the tony award for best sound design of a musical until the 2014-15 season
sound design for plays often involves the selection of music and sounds sound score for a production based on intimate familiarity with the play and the design installation calibration and utilization of the sound system that reproduces the sound score the sound designer for a play and the production's director work together to decide the themes and emotions to be explored based on this the sound designer for plays in collaboration with the director and possibly the composer decides upon the sounds that will be used to create the desired moods in some productions the sound designer might also be hired to compose music for the play the sound designer and the director usually work together to spot the cues in the play ie decide when and where sound will be used in the play some productions might use music only during scene changes whilst others might use sound effects likewise a scene might be underscored with music sound effects or abstract sounds that exist somewhere between the two some sound designers are accomplished composers writing and producing music for productions as well as designing sound many sound designs for plays also require significant sound reinforcement see sound design for musicals sound design for plays was recognized by the american theatre wing's tony awards with the tony award for best sound design of a play until the 2014-15 season
in contemporary music especially rock music ambient music progressive rock and similar genres the record producer and recording engineer play important roles in the creation of the overall sound or soundscape of a recording and less often of a live performance the record producer is chiefly responsible for extracting the best performance possible from the musicians and for making both musical and technical decisions about the instrumental timbres arrangements etc on certain ambitious and complex recording projects artists and producers have relied on sonic consultants often credited as sound designer to help them to create specific auditory effects landscapes or to ensure an overall consistency and quality of some of the usually unconventional sonic elements in such arrangements the producer may put almost all of his or her attention on managing the recording session and working closely with the musicians on their performances and interpretations of the material the recording engineer may dedicate all of his or her time to capturing these performances on tape or hard disk the sound designer may then help to create the overall sound the integration of recording technology with musical instrument technology the presentation that is the phonographic equivalent of decisions in movie-making about what type of lens to use on the camera whether or not to use soft focus and what kind of lighting to use on a scene
in applied research in electrostatics and computer programming for contemporary music or electronic music the sound designer is a specialist who is usually there to help the composer to do the electroacoustic portion of the composition often the composer comes with an idea concept + score and the sound designer assists the composer with new technology and unique equipment examples include sound synthesis interaction between acoustic instruments and computers realization of a computer program in many different languages often max-mspjitter gesture capture with sensors or cameras video treatment and interaction between video and sound historically the sound designer was often called the musical assistant some of the many examples of research centers working with sound designers include forum neues musiktheater of stuttgart ircam in paris or synart in antibes
notable examples of sound design are the contributions of michael brook to the u2 album the joshua tree george massenburg to the jennifer warnes album famous blue raincoat chris thomas to the pink floyd album the dark side of the moon and brian eno to the paul simon album surprise
