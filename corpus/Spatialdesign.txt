spatial design is a relatively new discipline that crosses the boundaries of traditional design disciplines such as architecture interior design landscape architecture and landscape design as well as public art within the public realm
it focuses upon the flow of space between interior and exterior environments both in the private and public realm the emphasis of the discipline is upon working with people and space particularly looking at the notion of place also place identity and genius loci as such the discipline covers a variety of scales from detailed design of interior spaces to large regional strategies and is largely found within the uk as a discipline it uses the language of architecture interior design and landscape architecture to communicate design intentions spatial design uses research methods often found in disciplines such as product and service design identified by ideo as well as social and historical methods that help with the identification and determination of place
as a growth area of design the number of spatial design practitioners work within existing disciplines or as independent consultants
the subject is studied at a number of institutions within the uk though as with any new field of study these courses differ in their scope and ambition
ultimately it can be seen as 'the glue that joins traditional built environment disciplines together'
