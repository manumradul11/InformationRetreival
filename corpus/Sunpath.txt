sun path refers to the apparent significant seasonal-and-hourly positional changes of the sun and length of daylight as the earth rotates and orbits around the sun the relative position of the sun is a major factor in the heat gain of buildings and in the performance of solar energy systems accurate location-specific knowledge of sun path and climatic conditions is essential for economic decisions about solar collector area orientation landscaping summer shading and the cost-effective use of solar trackers


sun paths at any latitude and any time of the year can be determined from basic geometry the earth's axis of rotation tilts about 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of earth's solar system orbit around the sun as the earth orbits the sun this creates the 47-degree peak-to-peak solar altitude angle difference and the hemisphere-specific difference between summer and winter
in the northern hemisphere the winter sun rises in the southeast peaks out at a low angle above the southern horizon and then sets in the southwest it is on the south equator side of the house all day long vertical south-facing equator side glass is excellent for capturing solar thermal energy
in the northern hemisphere in summer june july august the sun rises in the northeast peaks out nearly straight overhead depending on latitude and then sets in the northwest a simple latitude-dependent equator-side overhang can easily be designed to block 100% of the direct solar gain from entering vertical equator-facing windows on the hottest days of the year roll-down exterior shade screens interior translucent-or-opaque window quilts drapes shutters movable trellises etc can be used for hourly daily or seasonal sun and heat transfer control without any active electrical air conditioning the latitude and hemisphere-specific solar path differences are critical to effective passive solar building design they are essential data for optimal window and overhang seasonal design solar designers must know the precise solar path angles for each location they design for and how they compare to place-based seasonal heating and cooling requirements
in the us the precise location-specific altitude-and-azimuth seasonal solar path numbers are available from noaa – the equator side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere and north in the southern hemisphere where the peak summer solstice solar altitude occurs on december 21 the sun rises roughly in the east and sets in the west everywhere on earth except in high latitudes in summer- and winter-time
on the equator the sun will be straight overhead and a vertical stick will cast no shadow at solar noon on the equinoxes on the vernal equinox north of the subsolar point on the equator the vertical stick's shadow will point a little westwards of true north nnw reading 336.5° from true north and little eastwards of true south sse reading 156.5° from true north on the autumnal equinox north of the subsolar point on the equator the shadow will point a little eastwards of true north nne reading 23.5° from true north and south of the subsolar the shadow will point a little westward of true south ssw reading 203.5° from true north
the same stick will cast no shadow on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere when the subsolar point is on the tropic of cancer 23.44° north of equator although north of 23.44°n the shadow will point towards true north and south of 23.44°n the shadow will point towards true south the reverse occurs on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere when the subsolar point will be on the tropic of capricorn 23.44°s and a vertical stick will cast no shadow along that point but north of the tropic of capricorn solar noon shadows will point towards true north and south of the tropic of capricorn shadows will point towards true south
the solar noon shadows of objects on points beyond and below subsolar points will point towards true north and true south respectively only when the solar declination has its maximum positive δ☉ = +23.44° or maximum negative δ☉ = −23.44° value on the other hand on the equinoxes when the sun is neither declined north nor south δ☉ = 0° and solar time noon shadows point nnw north of the equator and sse south of the equator on the vernal equinox and point nne north of the equator and ssw south of the equator on the autumnal equinox
north of the arctic circle and south of the antarctic circle there will be at least one day a year when the sun is not above the horizon for 24 hours during the winter solstice and at least one day when the sun is above the horizon for 24 hours during the summer solstice
in the moderate latitudes between the circles and tropics where most humans live the length of the day solar altitude and azimuth vary from one day to the next and from season to season the difference between the length of a long summer day and a short winter day increases as one moves farther away from the equator
before the days of modern inexpensive 3d computer graphics a heliodon precisely-movable light source was used to show the angle of the sun on a physical model of a proposed building today mathematical computer models calculate location-specific solar gain shading and seasonal thermal performance with the ability to rotate and animate a 3d color graphic model of a proposed building design
heating and cooling issues in passive solar building design can be counterintuitive precise performance calculations and simulations are essential to avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating expensive experimental design errors such as skylights that turn a building into a solar furnace in summer see daylighting#sawtooth roof
these pictures show such a perspective as follows they show the day arcs of the sun the paths the sun tracks along the celestial dome in its diurnal movement the pictures show this for every hour on both solstice days the longer arc is always the summer track and the shorter one the winter track the two tracks are at a distance of 46.88° 2 × 23.44° away from each other
in addition some ghost suns are indicated below the horizon as much as 18° down the sun in this area causes twilight the pictures can be used for both the northern and southern hemispheres the observer is supposed to sit near the tree on the island in the middle of the ocean the green arrows give the cardinal directions
the following special cases are depicted
day arcs at 0° latitude equator
day arcs at 20° latitude
day arcs at 50° latitude
day arcs at 70° latitude
day arcs at 90° latitude pole
a handy site like httpsuncalcnet can bes used to check the relative path of sun at any location
