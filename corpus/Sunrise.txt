sunrise or sun up is the instant at which the upper edge of the sun appears over the eastern horizon in the morning the term can also refer to the entire process of the sun crossing the horizon and its accompanying atmospheric effects


although the sun appears to rise from the horizon it is actually the earth's motion that causes the sun to appear the illusion of a moving sun results from earth observers being in a rotating reference frame this apparent motion is so convincing that most cultures had mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model which prevailed until astronomer nicolaus copernicus first formulated the heliocentric model in the 16th century
architect buckminster fuller proposed the terms sunsight and sunclipse to better represent the heliocentric model though the terms have not entered into common language
astronomically sunrise occurs for only an instant the moment at which the upper limb of the sun appears tangent to the horizon however the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point
sunrise occurs before the sun actually reaches the horizon because the sun's image is refracted by the earth's atmosphere at the horizon the average amount of refraction is 34 arcminutes though this amount varies based on atmospheric conditions
also unlike most other solar measurements sunrise occurs when the sun's upper limb rather than its center appears to cross the horizon the apparent radius of the sun at the horizon is 16 arcminutes
these two angles combine to define sunrise to occur when the sun's center is 50 arcminutes below the horizon or 90.83° from the zenith
the timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's longitude and latitude altitude and time zone these changes are driven by the axial tilt of earth daily rotation of the earth the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the sun and the earth and moon's paired revolutions around each other the analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise
in late winter and spring sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice although the exact date varies by latitude after this point the time of sunrise gets later each day reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice the offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis and is described by the analemma which can be used to predict the dates
variations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position near the poles the time-of-day variation is exaggerated since the sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly
accounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night the sunrise equation however which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset uses the sun's physical center for calculation neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc
neglecting the effects of refraction and the sun's non-zero size whenever and wherever sunrise occurs it is always in the northeast quadrant from the march equinox to the september equinox and in the southeast quadrant from the september equinox to the march equinox sunrises occur due east on the march and september equinoxes for all viewers on earth exact calculations of the azimuths of sunrise on other dates are complex but they can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by using the analemma
air molecules and airborne particles scatter white sunlight as it passes through the earth's atmosphere this is done by a combination of rayleigh scattering and mie scattering
as a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to an observer some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles changing the final color of the beam the viewer sees because the shorter wavelength components such as blue and green scatter more strongly these colors are preferentially removed from the beam at sunrise and sunset when the path through the atmosphere is longer the blue and green components are removed almost completely leaving the longer wavelength orange and red hues we see at those times the remaining reddened sunlight can then be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles to light up the horizon red and orange the removal of the shorter wavelengths of light is due to rayleigh scattering by air molecules and particles much smaller than the wavelength of visible light less than 50 nm in diameter the scattering by cloud droplets and other particles with diameters comparable to or larger than the sunlight's wavelengths > 600 nm is due to mie scattering and is not strongly wavelength-dependent mie scattering is responsible for the light scattered by clouds and also for the daytime halo of white light around the sun forward scattering of white light without mie scattering at sunset and sunrise the sky along the horizon has only a dull-reddish appearance while the rest of the sky remains mostly blue and sometimes green
sunset colors are typically more brilliant than sunrise colors because the evening air contains more particles than morning air
ash from volcanic eruptions trapped within the troposphere tends to mute sunset and sunrise colors while volcanic ejecta that is instead lofted into the stratosphere as thin clouds of tiny sulfuric acid droplets can yield beautiful post-sunset colors called afterglows and pre-sunrise glows a number of eruptions including those of mount pinatubo in 1991 and krakatoa in 1883 have produced sufficiently high stratospheric sulfuric acid clouds to yield remarkable sunset afterglows and pre-sunrise glows around the world the high altitude clouds serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset down to the surface
