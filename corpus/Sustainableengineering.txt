sustainable engineering is the process of designing or operating systems such that they use energy and resources sustainably in other words at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment or the ability of future generations to meet their own needs


every engineering discipline is engaged in sustainable design employing numerous initiatives especially life cycle analysis lca pollution prevention design for the environment dfe design for disassembly dfd and design for recycling dfr these are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms for example concept of a cap and trade has been tested and works well for some pollutants this is a system where companies are allowed to place a bubble over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a stack-by-stack and pipe-by-pipe approach ie the so-called command and control approach such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants followed by higher operation and maintenance o&m technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes but the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity this is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches ie conducting a life-cycle analysis prioritizing the most important problems and matching the technologies and operations to address them the problems will vary by size eg pollutant loading difficulty in treating and feasibility the most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat ie less feasible of course as with all paradigm shifts expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective historically sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs for example hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated the hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types increasing waste handling facilities and if these did not entirely do the job limiting rates of production green engineering recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally calling for a comprehensive systematic life cycle approach green engineering attempts to achieve four goals
green engineering encompasses numerous ways to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental and sustainable standpoint every one of these approaches depends on viewing possible impacts in space and time architects consider the sense of place engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary the design must consider short and long-term impacts those impacts beyond the near-term are the province of sustainable design the effects may not manifest themselves for decades in the mid-twentieth century designers specified the use of what are now known to be hazardous building materials such as asbestos flooring pipe wrap and shingles lead paint and pipes and even structural and mechanical systems that may have increased the exposure to molds and radon those decisions have led to risks to people inhabiting these buildings it is easy in retrospect to criticize these decisions but many were made for noble reasons such as fire prevention and durability of materials however it does illustrate that seemingly small impacts when view through the prism of time can be amplified exponentially in their effects sustainable design requires a complete assessment of a design in place and time some impacts may not occur until centuries in the future for example the extent to which we decide to use nuclear power to generate electricity is a sustainable design decision the radioactive wastes may have half-lives of hundreds of thousands of years that is it will take all these years for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay radioactive decay is the spontaneous transformation of one element into another this occurs by irreversibly changing the number of protons in the nucleus thus sustainable designs of such enterprises must consider highly uncertain futures for example even if we properly place warning signs about these hazardous wastes we do not know if the english language will be understood all four goals of green engineering mentioned above are supported by a long-term life cycle point of view a life cycle analysis is a holistic approach to consider the entirety of a product process or activity encompassing raw materials manufacturing transportation distribution use maintenance recycling and final disposal in other words assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product the first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known the important functions and impacts of each step in the production manufacture use and recoverydisposal are estimated thus in sustainable design engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames
in 2013 the average annual electricity consumption for a us residential utility customer was 10908 kilowatt hours kwh an average of 909 kwh per month louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15270 kwh and hawaii had the lowest at 6176 kwh residential sector itself uses 18% of the total energy generated and therefore incorporating sustainable construction practices there can be significant reduction in this number basic sustainable construction practices includeÂ
