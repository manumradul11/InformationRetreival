systems oriented design sod uses system thinking in order to capture the complexity of systems addressed in design practice the main mission of sod is to build the designers' own interpretation and implementation of systems thinking sod aims at enabling systems thinking to fully benefit from design thinking and practice and design thinking and practice to fully benefit from systems thinking sod addresses design for human activity systems and can be applied to any kind of design problem ranging from product design and interaction design to decision making processes and policy design


design is getting more and more complex for a number of reasons for example due to globalization need for sustainability and the introduction of new technology and increased use of automation many of the challenges designers meet today can be considered wicked problems the characteristics of a wicked problem include among others that there are no definitive formulation of the problem and that the solutions are never true-or-false but rather better or worse a traditional problem solving approach is not sufficient in addressing for such design problems sod is an approach that addresses the challenges the designer faces when working with complex systems and wicked problems providing tools and techniques which makes it easier for the designer to grasp the complexity of the problem at hand with a systems oriented approach towards design the designer acknowledges that the starting point for the design process is constantly moving and that every implemented solution is consequential it leaves traces that cannot be undone see rittel and webber's 5th property of wicked problems
designers are well suited to work with complexity and wicked problems for a number of reasons
sod emphasizes these abilities as central and seeks to further train the designer in systems thinking and systems practice as a skill and an art
systems oriented design builds on systems theory and systems thinking in order to develop practices for addressing complexity in design particularly influential is soft systems methodology ssm acknowledging conflicting worldviews and people's purposeful actions and a systems view on creativity however sod is inspired by critical systems thinking and approaches systems theories in an eclectic way transforming the thoughts of the different theories to fit the design process the design disciplines build on their own traditions and have a certain way of working with problems often referred to as design thinkingnote 1 or the design way design thinking is a creative process based around the building up of ideas this style of thinking is one of the advantages of the designer and is the reason why simply employing one of the existing systems approach into design like for example systems engineering is not found sufficient by the advocates of sod
compared with other systems approaches sod is less concerned with hierarchies and borders of systems modelling and feedback loops and more focused on the whole fields of relations and patterns of interactions sod seeks richness rather than simplification of the complex systems
important in the systems oriented design process is to carry out activities in order to grasp the complexity of the system designed for and to accommodate for a creative process taking place in order to gain the necessary understanding of the complex system a comprehensive data capture and analysis phase is needed visualizations play a vital role in the design process both as a means to analyze and understand the information gathered and in order to communicate the obtained insight into the complex system is used to come up with solutions for the design problem
methods and techniques from other disciplines are used in order to understand the complexity of the system including for example ethnographic studies risk analysis and scenario thinking methods and concepts unique to sod include for example the rich design space giga-mapping and incubation techniques
the rich design space includes the physical space of the design studio with sketches ideas mood boards plans etc and the virtual digital design space of the design software media like video and sound recording traditional design techniques and even the social space created in the project by paying attention to the richness of the design space the design space can become a very efficient tool to maintain an overview of the complexity of the project all the way
giga-mapping is the central tool for registering analyzing and managing complexity in sod it is used for systematizing and interrelating the information and knowledge obtained
incubation is one of the 4 proposed stages of creativity preparation incubation illumination and verification incubation techniques are techniques used by the designer in order to acquire the background knowledge needed for an incubation process to take place
sod has proved valuable for designers to quickly acquire knowledge of a new domains and to reveal unexpected parts of a system where a new design can be beneficial
the concept of systems oriented design was initially proposed by professor birger sevaldson at the oslo school of architecture and design aho in the context of the ocean design research network the sod approach is currently under development through teaching and research projects as well as through the work of design practitioners aho provides master courses in systems oriented design each term as part of their industrial design program in these courses design students are trained in using the tools and techniques of sod in projects with outside partners research projects in systems oriented design are carried out at the centre for design research at aho in order to develop the concept methods and tools further
