systems design is the process of defining the architecture components modules interfaces and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development there is some overlap with the disciplines of systems analysis systems architecture and systems engineering


if the broader topic of product development blends the perspective of marketing design and manufacturing into a single approach to product development then design is the act of taking the marketing information and creating the design of the product to be manufactured systems design is therefore the process of defining and developing systems to satisfy specified requirements of the user
until the 1990s systems design had a crucial and respected role in the data processing industry in the 1990s standardization of hardware and software resulted in the ability to build modular systems the increasing importance of software running on generic platforms has enhanced the discipline of software engineering
object-oriented analysis and design methods are becoming the most widely used methods for computer systems designcitation needed the uml has become the standard language in object-oriented analysis and designcitation needed it is widely used for modeling software systems and is increasingly used for high designing non-software systems and organizationscitation needed
the architectural design of a system emphasizes on the design of the systems architecture which describes the structure behavior and more views of that system and analysis
the logical design of a system pertains to an abstract representation of the data flows inputs and outputs of the system this is often conducted via modelling using an over-abstract and sometimes graphical model of the actual system in the context of systems designs are included logical design includes entity-relationship diagrams er diagrams
the physical design relates to the actual input and output processes of the system this is explained in terms of how data is input into a system how it is verifiedauthenticated how it is processed and how it is displayed in physical design the following requirements about the system are decided
put another way the physical portion of systems design can generally be broken down into three sub-tasks
user interface design is concerned with how users add information to the system and with how the system presents information back to them data design is concerned with how the data is represented and stored within the system finally process design is concerned with how data moves through the system and with how and where it is validated secured andor transformed as it flows into through and out of the system at the end of the systems design phase documentation describing the three sub-tasks is produced and made available for use in the next phase
physical design in this context does not refer to the tangible physical design of an information system to use an analogy a personal computer's physical design involves input via a keyboard processing within the cpu and output via a monitor printer etc it would not concern the actual layout of the tangible hardware which for a pc would be a monitor cpu motherboard hard drive modems videographics cards usb slots etc it involves a detailed design of a user and a product database structure processor and a control processor the hs personal specification is developed for the proposed system
rapid application development rad is a methodology in which a systems designer produces prototypes for an end-user the end-user reviews the prototype and offers feedback on its suitability this process is repeated until the end-user is satisfied with the final system
joint application design jad is a methodology which evolved from rad in which a systems designer consults with a group consisting of the following parties
jad involves a number of stages in which the group collectively develops an agreed pattern for the design and implementation of the system
