technicism is a philosophical socio-economic and political system that refers to a predominant reliance on technology and technical knowledge as primary benefactors to society as a whole this is associated directly with the scientific method and applied science broadly both are essential tools for the development of current technology and vice versa


although it is considered a neologism since their firsts appearances rely in the 21st century we may also can find implicit past references to it in different works both scientific political or artistic especially in books and films of science fiction
some argue that the technicism is the belief that humanity will control exponential or totally its existence through technological tools in other words we will be able to master all or most of the problems through technological advances including the possible creation of an economy of abundance appealing to transhumanism or even to control time with very advanced technologies in the distant future
clarke's third law any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
technicism have an urge to get away or deviate -whitout deny- from superstition religion or other doctrines without empirical relevance with no quantitative methods or that are useless for technological development where it followers or people called technicists usually choose to follow or develop in fields related science engineering or other technicalscientific areas
it stands in contrast or opposition to current ideologies like neo-luddism anarcho-primitivism or other streams that reject or oppose technological development
technicism promotes the proposition of a form of government called technocracy associated meritocracy where power is entrusted to technical delegated institutions defined as a technobureaucratic not oligarchic administration which is responsible for managing key elements of a society by empiricalrational methodologies like the scientific method
although technicist economic and social theory is still in its early stage it is cataloged in the interdisciplinary field of ecological economics as socioeconomic system it promotes a collectivist and egalitarian approach where the only class division relies in technicaladministrative hierarchies which aims to reach orient or point to a post-scarcity economy absent from private property rejecting the price system and openly promoting a direct allocationplanned resource management by objectivescientific knowledge creating a society of free access focused on the automation of the means of production and steady state economy
on the other side it also promotes a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability and care of the biomass rejecting the use of pollutant types of energy and promoting renewable power sources such as wind geothermal solar hydraulic and even when it is feasible nuclear fusion energy
as an early reference example we could point to the technocratic movement that born in the united states during the 19th century which promoted an economic system called thermoeconomics which appeals to the laws of thermodynamics for the economic calculation distribution energy efficiency and sustainability
the geocultural approach which appears in france in 2013 points out that fragmented technical analyses are unable to understand the world in its globality civilisations which are living organisms cannot be apprehended only by the multiplication of technicist approaches thomas flichy de la neuville and oliver hanne propose to reintroduce political and cultural criteria alongside technical analyses so as to recover an intelligence of the world
