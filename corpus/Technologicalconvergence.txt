technological convergence is the tendency that as technology changes different technological systems sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks
digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate ittce information technologies telecommunication consumer electronics and entertainment previously separate technologies such as voice and telephony features data and productivity applications and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically
telecommunications convergence network convergence or simply convergence are broad terms used to describe emerging telecommunications technologies and network architecture used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as telephony and data communications into common interfaces on single devices such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web
media convergence in this instance is defined as the interlinking of computing and other information technologies media content and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the internet as well as the activities products and services that have emerged in the digital media space many expertswho? view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business government art journalism health and education are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of information and communication technology devices
also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different protocols this could be a prelude to artificial intelligence networks on the internet eventually leading to a powerful superintelligence via a technological singularity
convergent services such as voip iptv smart tv and others tend to replace the older technologies and thus can disrupt markets ip-based convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market
when the old technology converges into the public-owned common ip based services become access-independent or less dependent the old service is access-dependent


siddhartha menon defines convergence in his policy initiative dilemmas on media covergence a cross national perspective as integration and digitalization integration here is defined as a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform
digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure but by the content or the medium jan van dijk suggests that digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros
convergence is defined by blackman 1998 as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications computing and broadcasting into a single digital bit-stream mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology digital computers
communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently the older media such as television and radio are broadcasting networks with passive audiences convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information voice data and video telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity consequently the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience
the historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of mobile telephony and the internet although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products fixed and mobile operators were for most of the 1990s independent companies even when the same organization marketed both products these were sold and serviced independently
in the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and internet was going to replace broadcasting in nicholas negroponte's being digital negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting he also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the media conglomerate the monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow the combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws congress can invent the new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies
george gilder dismisses such claims sayingclarification needed the computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse the tv converged with the nickelodeon the word-processing program converged with the typewriter the cad program converged with the drafting board and digital desktop publishing converged with the linotype machine and the letterpress gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it
media companies put media convergence back to their agenda after the dot-com bubble burst erstwhile knight ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines newspaper and books in 1994
within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers radio or television was no longer sufficient
the rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations or individuals to deliver text audio and video material over the same wired wireless or fiber-optic connections at the same time it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information this digital convergence of news media in particular was called mediamorphosis by researcher roger fidler  in his 1997 book by that name today we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies changing the way we create consume learn and interact with each other
convergent solutions include both fixed-line and mobile technologies recent examples of new convergent services include
convergent technologies can integrate the fixed-line with mobile to deliver convergent solutions convergent technologies include
nbic an acronym for nanotechnology biotechnology information technology and cognitive science was in 2014 the most popular term for converging technologies it was introduced into public discourse through the publication of converging technologies for improving human performance a report sponsored in part by the us national science foundation
various other acronyms have been offered for the same concept such as gnr genetics nanotechnology and robotics bill joy 2000 why the future doesn't need us journalist joel garreau in radical evolution the promise and peril of enhancing our minds our bodies — and what it means to be human uses grin for genetic robotic information and nano processes while science journalist douglas mulhall in our molecular future how nanotechnology robotics genetics and artificial intelligence will transform our world uses grain for genetics robotics artificial intelligence and nanotechnology another acronym coined by the appropriate technology organization etc group is bang for bits atoms neurons genes
some expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device or black box as such media business practice has been to identify the next black box to invest in and provide media for this has caused a number of problems
firstly as black boxes are invented and abandoned the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task rather than one dedicated for each task for example one may own both a computer and a video games console subsequently owning two dvd players this is contrary to the streamlined goal of the black box theory and instead creates clutter
secondly technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature this has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder if not impractical to use rather than one specific device many people would only watch the tv for the duration of the meal's cooking time or whilst in the kitchen but would not use the microwave as the household tv these examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded
furthermore although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs other black box devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation as a 2002 cheskin research report explained
your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home work school commuting the airport etc and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context
despite the creation of black boxes intended to perform all of one's tasks the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position
due to the variable utility of portable technology convergence occurs in high end mobile devices they incorporate multimedia services gps internet access and mobile telephony into a single device heralding the rise of what has been termed the smart phone a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices
convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them also known as the black box this idea of one technology concocted by henry jenkins has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one for example while people can have e-mail and internet on their phone they still want full computers with internet and e-mail in addition
mobile phones are a good example in that they incorporate digital cameras mp3 players voice recorders and other devices this type of convergence is popularcitation needed for the consumer it means more features in less space for media conglomerates it means remaining competitive
however convergence has a downside particularly in initial forms converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts eg a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly due to not supporting certain rendering methods such as the iphone browser not supporting flash content as the number of functions in a single device escalates the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases as rheingold asserts technological convergence holds immense potential for the improvement of life and liberty in some ways and could degrade it in others he believes the same technology has the potential to be used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance
since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products this includes phone companies integrating 3g and 4g on their phones in the mid 20th century television converged the technologies of movies and radio and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the internet phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers
converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one newer mobile phones feature cameras and can hold images videos music and other media manufacturers now integrate more advanced features such as video recording gps receivers data storage and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone
the role of the internet has changed from its original use as a communication tool to provide easier and faster access to information mainly through a broadband connection the television radio and newspapers were the world's mediums for accessing news and entertainment now all three mediums have converged into one and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet the convergence of the internet and conventional tv become popular in the 2010s through smart tv also sometimes referred to as connected tv or hybrid tv not to be confused with iptv internet tv or with web tv
smart tv is used to describe the current trend of integration of the internet and web 2.0 features into modern television sets and set-top boxes as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes these new devices most often also have a much higher focus on online interactive media internet tv over-the-top content as well as on-demand streaming media and less focus on traditional broadcast media like previous generations of television sets and set-top boxes always have had
according to harry strasser former cto of siemens digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work stylecitation needed the next hot trend in digital convergence is converged content mixing personal user generated content with professional copyright protected contentcitation needed an example are personal music videos that combine user generated photos with chart music the german startup trivid gmbh has developed an award winning solution clipgenerator that enables users to create personal music videos with popular chart music and to share them in social communities such as facebook myspace and bebo
convergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together both as competitors and collaborators across traditional boundaries of industry and technology in a world dominated by convergence many traditional products services and types of companies will become less relevant but a stunning array of new ones is possible
an array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence including mobility analytics cloud digital and social networks as a disruptive force convergence is a threat to the unprepared but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules
with convergence lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets for instance mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile chemicals companies work with agribusiness device manufacturers sell music video and books booksellers become consumer device companies search and advertising companies become telcos media companies act like telcos and vice versa retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies and much much more mobile phone usage broadens dramatically becoming the means to do previously inconceivable things from making payments to watching videos to operating an intelligent home
generally media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product a system or a process jenkins states that convergence is
the flow of content across multiple media platforms the cooperation between multiple media industries and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted
according to jenkins there are five areas of convergence technological economic social or organic cultural and global
so media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process it also includes shifts within the industrial cultural and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information convergence simply put is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences new forms of media and content that connect us socially and not just to other consumers but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past
advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that rheingold believes can alter the social-side effects in that the virtual social and physical world are colliding merging and coordinating
it was predicted in the late 1980s around the time that cd-rom was becoming commonplace that a digital revolution would take place and that old media would be pushed to one side by new media broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the internet enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before
however when the dot com bubble of the 1990s suddenly popped that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolutioncitation needed in today's society the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry if this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted the paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything when the dot com market crashed there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed the real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change in that respect media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning
media convergence in reality is more than just a shift in technology it alters relationships between industries technologies audiences genres and markets media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome so no single black box controls the flow of media with proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us
media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view as these affect marketing and programming decisions media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers conversely it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms two examples of this are star wars and the matrix both are films but are also books video games cartoons and action figures branding encourages expansion of one concept rather than the creation of new ideas in contrast hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence hardware must be specific to each function
while most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating o'donnell suggests especially between films and video game the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry the conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media for example batman is in comics films anime and games however the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators the same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible in addition convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced no flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry

media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place in this current time with older forms of media and media companies media convergence has two roles the first is the technological merging of different media channels – for example magazines radio programs tv shows and movies now are available on the internet through laptops ipads and smartphones as discussed in media culture by campbell convergence of technology is not new it has been going on since the late 1920s an example is rca the radio corporation of america purchased victor talking machine company and introduced machines that could play both radio and recorded music next came the tv and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television which has both talking and music as well as visual as technology advancesconvergence of media’s change to keep up with the time the second definition of media convergence as campbell discusses is cross- platform by media marketeer’s which means consolidating various media holdings such as cable phone television and internet access under one corporate umbrella this is not for the consumer to have more media choices this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits as stated in the article convergence culture and media work by mark deuze the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies channels genres and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life work and play the local and the global self and social identity
henry jenkins determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms the cooperation between multiple media industries and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want the convergence culture is an important factor in transmedia storytelling convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many because of this culture a single piece of media content is represented in multiple forms of mediapage needed for instance the matrix starts as a film which is followed by two other installments but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form it becomes a story not only told in the movies but in animated shorts video games and comic books three different media platforms online a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon fan films discussion forums and social media pages also form expanding the matrix to different online platforms convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media

convergence culture is a part of participatory culture because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as youtube besides marketing and entertainment convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information we can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio tv newspapers and the internet the internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale for instance photographs were taken of torture at abu ghraib these photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet this led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers on tv and the internet
media scholar henry jenkins has described the media convergence with participatory culture as
a catalyst for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take star wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends—the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools which enable the grassroots archiving annotation appropriation and recirculation of media content these fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution

the integration of social movement in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies of social movement in the age of media convergence because of the neutrality of the internet and the end-to-end design the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications mexico's zapatistas campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age manuel castells defines the zapatistas as the first informational guerrilla movement the zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press the zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots decentralized social movement by using the internet the zapatistas effect observed by cleaver continues to organize social movements on a global scale a sophisticated webmetric analysis which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network demonstrates that the zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global ngos the majority of the social movement organized by zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism a successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street papic wrote social media alone do not instigate revolutions which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline
a study title journalism in the age of media convergence a survey of undergraduates’ technology-related news habits concluded that several focus group respondents reported they generally did not actively engage in media convergence such as viewing slide shows or listening to podcast that accompanied an online story as part of their web-based news consumption a significant number of students indicated the interactive features often associated with online news and media convergence were indeed appealing to them
the us federal communications commission fcc has not been able to decide how to regulate voip internet telephony because the convergent technology is still growing and changing in addition to its growth fcc is tentative to set regulation on voip in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry there is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media historically telecommunication is subject to state regulation the state of california concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the universal service fund
some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology meisel and needles 2005 suggests that the fcc federal courts and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which internet telephony market grows on one hand the fcc is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because voip with different feature from the old telecommunication no fixed model to build legislature yet on the other hand the regulations is needed because service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service which will affect the entire economy
convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services as the lines between data transmission and voice and media transmission are eroded regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector traditionally telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure networks and access to network no content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private in contrast film and television are regulated by contents the rating system regulates its distribution to the audience
self-regulation is promoted by the industry bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the advertising standards authority which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry
the premises to regulate the new media two-ways communications concerns much about the change from old media to new media each medium has different features and characteristics first internet the new medium manipulates all form of information - voice data and video second the old regulation on the old media such as radio and television emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels internet on the other hand has the limitless capacity due to the end-to-end design third two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences fundamental basis for classification therefore is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interestsblackman

wu and lessig 2004 explain two reasons to adapt neutral network first a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development second neutral network facilitates fair competition among application no bias between applications the two reasons also coincide with fcc's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services despite regulatory efforts of deregulation privatization and liberalization the infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition kim et al argues that ip dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation   the neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition
as the former fcc charman michael powell puts it from its inception the internet was designed as those present during the course of its creating will tell you to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it it was designed to defeat discrimination against users ideas and technologies  because of these reasons shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately
the layer model is first proposed by solum and chug sicker and nakahata sicker warbach and witt have supported using layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services many researchers have different layered approach but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations the key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture and current business model the layered model consists of 1 access layer - where the physical infrastructure resides copper wires cable or fiber optic 2 transport layer - the provider of service 3 application layer - the interface between the data and the users 4 content layer - the layer which users see in convergence technologies and the layered policy model implication for regulating future communications shin combines the layered model and network neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent media industry
combination services include those that integrate sms with voice such as voice sms providers include bubble motion jott kirusa and spinvox several operators have launched services that combine sms with mobile instant messaging mim and presence
text-to-landline services also exist where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates this service has been popular in america where fixed and mobile numbers are similar
inbound sms has been converging to enable reception of different formats sms voice mms etc uk companies including consumer goods companies and media giants should soonwhen? be able to let consumers contact them via voice sms mms ivr or video using one five-digit number or long number in april 2008 o2 uk launched voice-enabled shortcodes adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for sms
this type of convergence is particularly helpful for media companies broadcasters enterprises call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer because sms is very popular today it became relevant to include text messaging as a contact possibility for consumers to avoid having multiple numbers one for voice calls another one for sms a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number this means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received
mobile service provisions refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services but the ability to wirelessly access everything voice internet audio and video advancements in wimax and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds distances and non-line-of-sight conditions
multi-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services such as internet access television telephone and mobile phone service by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services multi-play is a catch-all phrase usually the terms triple play voice video and data or quadruple play voice video data and wireless are used to describe a more specific meaning
a dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services it can be high-speed internet digital subscriber line and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies or high-speed internet cable modem and tv service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable tv companies
the convergence can also concern the underlying communication infrastructure an example of this is a triple play service where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase tv internet and telephony in one subscription
a quadruple play service combines the triple play service of broadband internet access television and telephone with wireless service provisions this service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as the fantastic four or grand slam
the broadband cable market is transforming as pay-tv providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space meanwhile customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content multi-use devices networked products and converged services including on-demand video digital tv high speed internet voip and wireless applications it's uncharted territory for most broadband companies
a fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved many of them from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested opportunities are attractive the big three telecom services – telephony cable television and wireless—could combine their industries
in the uk the recent merger of ntltelewest and virgin mobile resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television broadband internet home telephone and mobile telephone services
early in the 21st century home lan convergence so rapidly integrated home routers wireless access points and dsl modems that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their internet service a general term for such a combined device is a residential gateway
