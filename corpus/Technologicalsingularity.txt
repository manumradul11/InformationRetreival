the technological singularity is a hypothetical event in which artificial general intelligence constituting for example intelligent computers computer networks or robots would be capable of recursive self-improvement progressively redesigning itself or of autonomously building ever smarter and more powerful machines than itself up to the point of a runaway effect—an intelligence explosion—that yields an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding because the capabilities of such a superintelligence may be impossible for a human to comprehend the technological singularity is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence
the first use of the term singularity in this context was made by stanislaw ulam in his 1958 obituary for john von neumann in which he mentioned a conversation with von neumann about the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs as we know them could not continue the term was popularized by mathematician computer scientist and science fiction author vernor vinge who argues that artificial intelligence human biological enhancement or brain–computer interfaces could be possible causes of the singularity futurist ray kurzweil cited von neumann's use of the term in a foreword to von neumann's classic the computer and the brain
kurzweil predicts the singularity to occur around 2045 whereas vinge predicts some time before 2030 in 2012 stuart armstrong and kaj sotala published a study of artificial general intelligence agi predictions by both experts and non-experts and found a wide range of predicted dates with a median value of 2040 discussing the level of uncertainty in agi estimates armstrong stated at the 2012 singularity summit it's not fully formalized but my current 80% estimate is something like five to 100 years


strong ai might bring about an intelligence explosion a term coined in 1965 by i j good although technological progress has been accelerating it has been limited by the basic intelligence of the human brain which has not according to paul r ehrlich changed significantly for millennia however with the increasing power of computers and other technologies it might eventually be possible to build a machine that is more intelligent than humanity if a superhuman intelligence were to be invented—either through the amplification of human intelligence or through artificial intelligence—it might be able to bring to bear greater problem-solving and inventive skills than current humans are capable of it might then design an even more capable machine or re-write its own software to become even more intelligent this more capable machine could then go on to design a machine of yet greater capability these iterations of recursive self-improvement could accelerate potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in
many of the most recognized writers on the singularity such as vernor vinge and ray kurzweil define the concept in terms of the technological creation of superintelligence they argue that it is difficult or impossible for present-day humans to predict what human beings' lives will be like in a post-singularity world the term technological singularity was originally coined by vinge who made an analogy between the breakdown in our ability to predict what would happen after the development of superintelligence and the breakdown of the predictive ability of modern physics at the space-time singularity beyond the event horizon of a black hole
some writers use the singularity in a broader way to refer to any radical changes in our society brought about by new technologies such as molecular nanotechnology although vinge and other prominent writers specifically state that without superintelligence such changes would not qualify as a true singularity many writers also tie the singularity to observations of exponential growth in various technologies with moore's law being the most prominent example using such observations as a basis for predicting that the singularity is likely to happen sometime within the 21st century
gary marcus claims that virtually everyone in the ai field believes that machines will one day overtake humans and at some level the only real difference between enthusiasts and skeptics is a time frame however many prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity including paul allen jeff hawkins john holland jaron lanier and gordon moore whose moore's law is often cited in support of the concept
the exponential growth in computing technology suggested by moore's law is commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of moore's law computer scientist and futurist hans moravec proposed in a 1998 book that the exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies prior to the integrated circuit futurist ray kurzweil postulates a law of accelerating returns in which the speed of technological change and more generally all evolutionary processes increases exponentially generalizing moore's law in the same manner as moravec's proposal and also including material technology especially as applied to nanotechnology medical technology and others between 1986 and 2007 machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita has roughly doubled every 14 months the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers has doubled every 18 months the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months and the world's storage capacity per capita doubled every 40 months like other authors though kurzweil reserves the term singularity for a rapid increase in intelligence as opposed to other technologies writing for example that the singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains  there will be no distinction post-singularity between human and machine he believes that the design of the human brain while not simple is nonetheless a billion times simpler than it appears due to massive redundancy according to kurzweil the reason why the brain has a messy and unpredictable quality is because the brain like most biological systems is a probabilistic fractal he also defines his predicted date of the singularity 2045 in terms of when he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower writing that advances in computing before that date will not represent the singularity because they do not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence
some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology in one of the first uses of the term singularity in the context of technological progress stanislaw ulam 1958 tells of a conversation with john von neumann about accelerating change
one conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs as we know them could not continue
hawkins 1983 writes that mindsteps dramatic and irreversible changes to paradigms or world views are accelerating in frequency as quantified in his mindstep equation he cites the inventions of writing mathematics and the computer as examples of such changes
kurzweil's analysis of history concludes that technological progress follows a pattern of exponential growth following what he calls the law of accelerating returns whenever technology approaches a barrier kurzweil writes new technologies will surmount it he predicts paradigm shifts will become increasingly common leading to technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century setting the date at 2045 his predictions differ from vinge’s in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity rather than vinge’s rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence
presumably a technological singularity would lead to rapid development of a kardashev type i civilization one that has achieved mastery of the resources of its home planet
oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology and genetic engineering these threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics and were the subject of bill joy's wired magazine article why the future doesn't need us
the acceleration studies foundation an educational non-profit foundation founded by john smart engages in outreach education research and advocacy concerning accelerating change it produces the accelerating change conference at stanford university and maintains the educational site acceleration watch
recent advances such as the mass production of graphene using modified kitchen blenders 2014 and high temperature superconductors based on metamaterials could allow supercomputers to be built that while using only as much power as a typical core i7 45w could achieve the same computing power as ibm's blue genel system
some critics assert that no computer or machine will ever achieve human intelligence while others hold that the definition of intelligence is irrelevant if the net result is the same
steven pinker stated in 2008
 there is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity the fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible look at domed cities jet-pack commuting underwater cities mile-high buildings and nuclear-powered automobiles—all staples of futuristic fantasies when i was a child that have never arrived sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems 
martin ford in the lights in the tunnel automation accelerating technology and the economy of the future postulates a technology paradox in that before the singularity could occur most routine jobs in the economy would be automated since this would require a level of technology inferior to that of the singularity this would cause massive unemployment and plummeting consumer demand which in turn would destroy the incentive to invest in the technologies that would be required to bring about the singularity job displacement is increasingly no longer limited to work traditionally considered to be routine
joan slonczewski and adam gopnik argue that the singularity is a gradual process that as humans gradually outsource our abilities to machines we redefine those abilities as inhuman without realizing how little is left this concept is called the mitochondrial singularity the idea refers to mitochondria the organelle that evolved from autonomous bacteria but now powers our living cells in the future the human being within the machine exoskeleton may exist only to turn it on
jared diamond in collapse how societies choose to fail or succeed argues that cultures self-limit when they exceed the sustainable carrying capacity of their environment and the consumption of strategic resources frequently timber soils or water creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression
theodore modis and jonathan huebner argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise but is actually now declining john smart however criticizes huebner's analysis evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer clock rates is slowing even while moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold this is due to excessive heat build-up from the chip which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent the chip from melting when operating at higher speeds advancements in speed may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient cpu designs and multi-cell processors while kurzweil used modis' resources and modis' work was around accelerating change modis distanced himself from kurzweil's thesis of a technological singularity claiming that it lacks scientific rigor
otherswho? propose that other singularities can be found through analysis of trends in world population world gross domestic product and other indices andrey korotayev and others argue that historical hyperbolic growth curves can be attributed to feedback loops that ceased to affect global trends in the 1970s and thus hyperbolic growth should not be expected in the future
in the progress of computing william nordhaus argued that prior to 1940 computers followed the much slower growth of a traditional industrial economy thus rejecting extrapolations of moore's law to 19th-century computers schmidhuber 2006 suggests differences in memory of recent and distant events create an illusion of accelerating change and that such phenomena may be responsible for past apocalyptic predictions
andrew kennedy in his 2006 paper for the british interplanetary society discussing change and the growth in space travel velocities stated that although long-term overall growth is inevitable it is small embodying both ups and downs and noted new technologies follow known laws of power use and information spread and are obliged to connect with what already exists remarkable theoretical discoveries if they end up being used at all play their part in maintaining the growth rate they do not make its plotted curve redundant he stated that exponential growth is no predictor in itself and illustrated this with examples such as quantum theory the quantum was conceived in 1900 and quantum theory was in existence and accepted approximately 25 years later however it took over 40 years for richard feynman and others to produce meaningful numbers from the theory bethe understood nuclear fusion in 1935 but 75 years later fusion reactors are still only used in experimental settings similarly quantum entanglement was understood in 1935 but not at the point of being used in practice until the 21st century
paul allen argues the opposite of accelerating returns the complexity brake the more progress science makes towards understanding intelligence the more difficult it becomes to make additional progress a study of the number of patents shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns but in fact as suggested by joseph tainter in his the collapse of complex societies a law of diminishing returns the number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850 to 1900 and has been declining since the growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting and leads to a widespread general systems collapse
jaron lanier refutes the idea that the singularity is inevitable he states i do not think the technology is creating itself it’s not an autonomous process he goes on to assert the reason to believe in human agency over technological determinism is that you can then have an economy where people earn their own way and invent their own lives if you structure a society on not emphasizing individual human agency it's the same thing operationally as denying people clout dignity and self-determination  to embrace the idea of the singularity would be a celebration of bad data and bad politics
in addition to general criticisms of the singularity concept several critics have raised issues with kurzweil's iconic chart one line of criticism is that a log-log chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line result others identify selection bias in the points that kurzweil chooses to use for example biologist pz myers points out that many of the early evolutionary events were picked arbitrarily kurzweil has rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources and showing that they fit a straight line on a log-log chart the economist mocked the concept with a graph extrapolating that the number of blades on a razor which has increased over the years from one to as many as five will increase ever-faster to infinitycitation needed
the term technological singularity reflects the idea that such change may happen suddenly and that it is difficult to predict how the resulting new world would operate it is unclear whether an intelligence explosion of this kind would be beneficial or harmful or even an existential threat as the issue has not been dealt with by most artificial general intelligence researchers although the topic of friendly artificial intelligence is investigated by the future of humanity institute and the singularity institute for artificial intelligence which is now the machine intelligence research institute
in february 2009 under the auspices of the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence aaai eric horvitz chaired a meeting of leading computer scientists artificial intelligence researchers and roboticists at asilomar in pacific grove california the goal was to discuss the potential impact of the hypothetical possibility that robots could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions they discussed the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire autonomy and to what degree they could use such abilities to pose threats or hazards
some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy including the ability to locate their own power sources and choose targets to attack with weapons also some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved cockroach intelligence the conference attendees noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely but that other potential hazards and pitfalls exist
some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions a united states navy report indicates that as military robots become more complex there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions
the aaai has commissioned a study to examine this issue pointing to programs like the language acquisition device which was claimed to emulate human interaction
some support the design of friendly artificial intelligence meaning that the advances that are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane
isaac asimov's three laws of robotics is one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for ai the laws are intended to prevent artificially intelligent robots from harming humans in asimov’s stories any perceived problems with the laws tend to arise as a result of a misunderstanding on the part of some human operator the robots themselves are merely acting to their best interpretation of their rules in the 2004 film i robot loosely based on asimov's robot stories an ai attempts to take complete control over humanity for the purpose of protecting humanity from itself due to an extrapolation of the three laws in 2004 the machine intelligence research institute launched an internet campaign called 3 laws unsafe to raise awareness of ai safety issues and the inadequacy of asimov’s laws in particular
in his 2005 book the singularity is near kurzweil suggests that medical advances would allow people to protect their bodies from the effects of aging making the life expectancy limitless kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine would allow us to continuously repair and replace defective components in our bodies prolonging life to an undetermined age kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bioengineering advances kurzweil analyzed somatic gene therapy sgt which is where scientists attempt to infect patients with modified viruses with the goal of altering the dna in cells that lead to degenerative diseases and aging celera genomics a company focused on creating genetic sequencing technology has already fulfilled the task of creating synthetic viruses with specific genetic information the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy kurzweil’s point is that sgt provides the best example of how immortality is achievable by replacing our dna with synthesized genes
computer scientist jaron lanier writes the singularity involves people dying in the flesh and being uploaded into a computer and remaining conscious the essence of lanier’s argument is that in order to keep living even after death we would need to abandon our physical bodies and have our minds programmed into a virtual reality this parallels the religious concept of an afterlife where one continues to exist beyond physical death
strong artificial intelligence can also be idealized as a matter of faith and ray kurzweil is said to have said that the creation of a deity may be the possible outcome of the singularity
singularitarianism has been likened to a religion by john horgan
nicolas de condorcet the 18th-century french mathematician philosopher and revolutionary is commonly creditedcitation needed for being one of the earliest persons to contend the existence of a singularity in his 1794 sketch for a historical picture of the progress of the human mind condorcet states
nature has set no term to the perfection of human faculties that the perfectibility of man is truly indefinite and that the progress of this perfectibility from now onwards independent of any power that might wish to halt it has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has cast us this progress will doubtless vary in speed but it will never be reversed as long as the earth occupies its present place in the system of the universe and as long as the general laws of this system produce neither a general cataclysm nor such changes as will deprive the human race of its present faculties and its present resources
in 1847 r thornton the editor of the expounder of primitive christianity wrote about the recent invention of a four-function mechanical calculator
such machines by which the scholar may by turning a crank grind out the solution of a problem without the fatigue of mental application would by its introduction into schools do incalculable injury but who knows that such machines when brought to greater perfection may not think of a plan to remedy all their own defects and then grind out ideas beyond the ken of mortal mind
in 1863 samuel butler wrote darwin among the machines which was later incorporated into his famous novel erewhon he pointed out the rapid evolution of technology and compared it with the evolution of life he wrote
reflect upon the extraordinary advance which machines have made during the last few hundred years and note how slowly the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing the more highly organised machines are creatures not so much of yesterday as of the last five minutes so to speak in comparison with past time assume for the sake of argument that conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years see what strides machines have made in the last thousand may not the world last twenty million years longer? if so what will they not in the end become?we cannot calculate on any corresponding advance in man’s intellectual or physical powers which shall be a set-off against the far greater development which seems in store for the machines
in 1909 the historian henry adams wrote an essay the rule of phase applied to history in which he developed a physical theory of history by applying the law of inverse squares to historical periods proposing a law of the acceleration of thought adams interpreted history as a process moving towards an equilibrium and speculated that this process would bring thought to the limit of its possibilities in the year 1921 it may well be adding that the consequences may be as surprising as the change of water to vapor of the worm to the butterfly of radium to electrons the futurist john smart has called adams earth's first singularity theorist
in 1951 alan turing spoke of machines outstripping humans intellectually
once the machine thinking method has started it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers  at some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control in the way that is mentioned in samuel butler's erewhon
in his obituary for john von neumann stanislaw ulam recalled a conversation with von neumann about the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs as we know them could not continue
in 1965 i j good first wrote of an intelligence explosion suggesting that if machines could even slightly surpass human intellect they could improve their own designs in ways unforeseen by their designers and thus recursively augment themselves into far greater intelligences the first such improvements might be small but as the machine became more intelligent it would become better at becoming more intelligent which could lead to a cascade of self-improvements and a sudden surge to superintelligence or a singularity
in 1983 mathematician and author vernor vinge greatly popularized good’s notion of an intelligence explosion in a number of writings first addressing the topic in print in the january 1983 issue of omni magazine in this op-ed piece vinge seems to have been the first to use the term singularity in a way that was specifically tied to the creation of intelligent machines writing
we will soon create intelligences greater than our own when this happens human history will have reached a kind of singularity an intellectual transition as impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole and the world will pass far beyond our understanding this singularity i believe already haunts a number of science-fiction writers it makes realistic extrapolation to an interstellar future impossible to write a story set more than a century hence one needs a nuclear war in between  so that the world remains intelligible
in 1984 samuel r delany used cultural fugue as a plot device in his science-fiction novel stars in my pocket like grains of sand the terminal runaway of technological and cultural complexity in effect destroys all life on any world on which it transpires a process poorly understood by the novel's characters and against which they seek a stable defense in 1985 ray solomonoff introduced the notion of infinity point in the time-scale of artificial intelligence analyzed the magnitude of the future shock that we can expect from our ai expanded scientific community and on social effects estimates were made for when these milestones would occur followed by some suggestions for the more effective utilization of the extremely rapid technological growth that is expected
vinge also popularized the concept in sf novels such as marooned in realtime 1986 and a fire upon the deep 1992 the former is set in a world of rapidly accelerating change leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time-intervals until a point beyond human comprehension is reached the latter starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a superintelligence passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a transcendent almost omnipotent power unfathomable by mere humans vinge also implies that the development may not stop at this level
in his 1988 book mind children computer scientist and futurist hans moravec generalizes moore's law to make predictions about the future of artificial life moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in this regard in that robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species starting around 2030–40 in robot mere machine to transcendent mind published in 1998 moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence generalizing moore's law to technologies predating the integrated circuit and speculating about a coming mind fire of rapidly expanding superintelligence similar to vinge's ideas
a 1993 article by vinge the coming technological singularity how to survive in the post-human era spread widely on the internet and helped to popularize the idea this article contains the oft-quoted statement within thirty years we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence shortly after the human era will be ended vinge refines his estimate of the time-scales involved adding i'll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030
vinge predicted four ways the singularity could occur
vinge continues by predicting that superhuman intelligences will be able to enhance their own minds faster than their human creators when greater-than-human intelligence drives progress vinge writes that progress will be much more rapid he predicts that this feedback loop of self-improving intelligence will cause large amounts of technological progress within a short period and states that the creation of superhuman intelligence represents a breakdown in humans' ability to model their future his argument was that authors cannot write realistic characters who surpass the human intellect as the thoughts of such an intellect would be beyond the ability of humans to express vinge named this event the singularity

in 2005 ray kurzweil published the singularity is near which brought the idea of the singularity to the popular media both through the book's accessibility and through a publicity campaign that included an appearance on the daily show with jon stewart the book stirred intense controversy in part because kurzweil's utopian predictions contrasted starkly with other darker visions of the possibilities of the singularityoriginal research? kurzweil his theories and the controversies surrounding it were the subject of barry ptolemy's documentary transcendent man
in 2007 eliezer yudkowsky suggested that many of the varied definitions that have been assigned to singularity are mutually incompatible rather than mutually supporting for example kurzweil extrapolates current technological trajectories past the arrival of self-improving ai or superhuman intelligence which yudkowsky argues represents a tension with both i j good's proposed discontinuous upswing in intelligence and vinge's thesis on unpredictability
in 2008 robin hanson taking singularity to refer to sharp increases in the exponent of economic growth listed the agricultural and industrial revolutions as past singularities extrapolating from such past events hanson proposes that the next economic singularity should increase economic growth between 60 and 250 times an innovation that allowed for the replacement of virtually all human labor could trigger this event
in 2009 kurzweil and x-prize founder peter diamandis announced the establishment of singularity university whose stated mission is to educate inspire and empower leaders to apply exponential technologies to address humanity’s grand challenges funded by google autodesk eplanet ventures and a group of technology industry leaders singularity university is based at nasa's ames research center in mountain view california the not-for-profit organization runs an annual ten-week graduate program during the northern-hemisphere summer that covers ten different technology and allied tracks and a series of executive programs throughout the year
in 2010 aubrey de grey applied the term methuselarity to the point at which medical technology improves so fast that expected human lifespan increases by more than one year per year in apocalyptic ai – visions of heaven in robotics artificial intelligence and virtual reality 2010 robert geraci offers an account of the developing cyber-theology inspired by singularity studies the 1996 novel holy fire by bruce sterling explores some of those themes and postulates that a methuselarity will become a gerontocracy
in 2011 kurzweil noted existing trends and concluded that it appeared increasingly likely that the singularity would occur around 2045 he told time magazine we will successfully reverse-engineer the human brain by the mid-2020s by the end of that decade computers will be capable of human-level intelligence
james p hogan's 1979 novel the two faces of tomorrow is an explicit description of what is now called the singularity an artificial intelligence system solves an excavation problem on the moon in a brilliant and novel way but nearly kills a work crew in the process realizing that systems are becoming too sophisticated and complex to predict or manage a scientific team sets out to teach a sophisticated computer network how to think more humanly the story documents the rise of self-awareness in the computer system the humans' loss of control and failed attempts to shut down the experiment as the computer desperately defends itself and the computer intelligence reaching maturity
while discussing the singularity's growing recognition vernor vinge wrote in 1993 that it was the science-fiction writers who felt the first concrete impact in addition to his own short story bookworm run whose protagonist is a chimpanzee with intelligence augmented by a government experiment he cites greg bear's novel blood music 1983 as an example of the singularity in fiction vinge described surviving the singularity in his 1986 novel marooned in realtime vinge later expanded the notion of the singularity to a galactic scale in a fire upon the deep 1992 a novel populated by transcendent beings each the product of a different race and possessed of distinct agendas and overwhelming power
