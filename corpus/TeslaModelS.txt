the tesla model s is a full-sized all-electric five-door luxury liftback produced by tesla motors and introduced in june 2012 it scored a perfect 5.0 nhtsa automobile safety rating the united states environmental protection agency epa official range for the 2012 model s performance model equipped with an 85 kwh 310 mj battery pack is 265 miles 426 km higher than any other electric car at the time epa rates its energy consumption at 237.5 watt·hour per kilometer 38 kwh100 mi or 24 kwh100 km for a combined fuel economy of 89 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent 2.64 l100 km or 107 mpg-imp
the model s became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country twice leading in norway in september and again in december 2013 and also in denmark in december 2015 global model s sales passed the 100000 unit milestone in december 2015
the model s ranked as the world's best selling plug-in electric vehicle in 2015 up from second best in 2014 the model s also ranked as the top selling plug-in electric car in the us in 2015 as of december 2015update the leading markets are the united states with a 60% share of global sales and norway with 9.4% other leading country markets are china the netherlands canada denmark germany and switzerland  as of december 2015update the model s ranks as the world's second best selling plug-in car in history after the nissan leaf
the tesla model s won awards including the 2013 world green car of the year 2013 motor trend car of the year automobile magazine's 2013 car of the year time magazine best 25 inventions of the year 2012 award and consumer reports' top-scoring car ever in 2015 car and driver named the model s the car of the century


the model s was styled by franz von holzhausen who previously worked for mazda north american operations the car was codenamed whitestar during research and preliminary development
the model s was announced in a press release on june 30 2008 the prototype vehicle was displayed at a press conference on march 26 2009
in february 2008 it was reported that tesla motors was planning to offer a range-extended version of its model s this version would have included a gasoline engine to extend the driving range of the vehicle but it was removed in later revisions at the goinggreen conference in september 2008 tesla's ceo elon musk announced that tesla was developing only electric cars
construction of an assembly factory in albuquerque new mexico a central location for shipping was supposed to begin in april 2007 but was cancelled a factory to be built in san jose california was also announced in may 2010 tesla announced it would produce the model s at the former nummi assembly plant in fremont california now known as the tesla factory this third plan was implemented
in june 2015 three years after the model s introduction and with almost 75000 model s sedans delivered worldwide tesla announced that model s owners have accumulated over 1 billion electric miles 1.6 billion km traveled and saved more than half a million tons of co2 the tesla model s is the first plug-in electric vehicle to reach that milestone in october 2014 general motors reported that volt owners had accumulated a total of 629 million all-electric miles over 1 billion kilometers out of a total of 1 billion miles 1.6 billion km traveled while nissan reported in december 2014 that leaf owners had traveled 625 million miles 1 billion kilometers tesla also reported that 68% of model s travel took place in north america 25% in europe and 7% in asia-pacific global model s sales passed the 100000 unit milestone in december 2015
in 2016 a racing series called the electric gt world series was promoted in preparation for a 2017 racing season using the p85+ as a race car on certain traditional tracks the first season is planned to have 20 cars in 10 teams
tesla manufactures the model s at the 5.4 million square foot tesla factory in fremont california for the european market tesla assembles and distributes from its european distribution center in tilburg the netherlands cars are built and tested in fremont california the battery pack the electric motor and parts are disassembled and shipped separately to tilburg where the cars are reassembled the center occupies a 203000 sq ft 18900 m2 industrial building that also serves as a workshop and spare parts warehouse tesla expects the model s to pay back the energy that went into producing the car in fewer than 10000 miles 16000 km
the first ten customers received their cars at the fremont factory on june 22 2012 at the official launch production grew from 15–20 cars completedweek in august 2012 to about 1000 cars per week in 2015
in october 2015 tesla motors announced the company is negotiating with the chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically local production has the potential to reduce the sales prices of tesla models by a third a model s starts at about us$76000 in the us while in china pricing starts at cn¥673000 about us$106000 after duties and other taxes elon musk clarified that production will remain in the us but if there's sufficient local demand for the tesla model 3 in china a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model production in europe will also depend on the region's demand for the model 3
the model s exists in several versions differing in energy capacity battery size power motor size and equipment
the 2012 tesla model s performance model has a three phase four pole ac induction 416 hp 310 kw and 443 ft·lb 600 n·m rear-mounted electric motor with copper rotor the base model uses a 362 hp 270 kw and 325 ft·lb 440 n·m motor the company claimed a drag coefficient of cd0.24 lower than any car when released models of mercedes-benz cla-class released later appeared to surpass the model s however independent measurement by car and driver in may 2014 bore out tesla's claim by exactly confirming a drag coefficient of cd0.24 but in the same test measured the mercedes cla at cd0.30 putting mercedes' claim into question
the rear axle has a traditional open differential models with dual motors also have an open differential on the front axles as well the front and rear axles have no mechanical linkage – with dual motors the power distribution among them is controlled electronically
the discontinued model s p85 top speed is 130 mph 210 kmh and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97 kmh in 4.2 seconds the replacement model s 85d has a top speed of 155 mph 249 kmh and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97 kmh in 4.2 seconds despite the lower total motor power in part due to the improved traction of the all-wheel drive powertrain the model s p85d a dual motor all-wheel drive vehicle has a governed top speed of 155 mph 249 kmh and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97 kmh in 3.2 seconds tested to 3.1 seconds under insane mode with 1g of acceleration new p85ds have an optional ludicrous mode hardware package available with the 90 kwh battery upgrade thus becoming a p90d that improves the 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97 kmh acceleration to 2.8 seconds and 1.1g
the powertrain also provides regenerative braking power of more than 60 kw which reduces both energy consumption and improves brake lifetime
in july 2015 tesla announced its goal to make the model s powertrain last for one million miles
on october 9 2014 tesla announced the introduction of all wheel drive awd versions of the model s's 60 85 and p85 models designated by a d at the end of the model number
on april 8 2015 tesla introduced the model s 70d as its new us$75000 entry-level car with all-wheel drive and an improved range of 240 miles 385 km the 70d replaced the 60 and 60d in the model s lineup with the latter two models no longer being available for purchase the p85 option was also dropped
in the 85d the rear drive unit is replaced by a smaller one to save cost and weight while a second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels this results in an awd car with comparable power and acceleration to the rwd version while keeping the price increase to us$5000 additionally the 85d reports a 2% 5-mile range increase and 11% increase in top speed over the 85 presumably due to incremental improvements in hardware and software in the p85d the high-power rear drive unit is retained while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50% this results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed the 85 kwh version rose from us$81070 to us$86070 while the p85 now the p85d jumped from us$94570 to us$105670 deliveries of the p85d started in december 2014 with the 85d models starting in february 2015 and the 70d models starting in april 2015
the 60 kwh electric vehicle battery was rated to deliver 230 miles 370 km while an 85 kwh battery was rated at 320 miles 510 km assuming a constant speed of 55 mph 89 kmh in 2012 the epa range for the 60 kwh battery pack model is 208 mi 335 km and the 85 kwh battery is 265 miles 426 km according to musk the model s has a battery with twice the energy density of that on the nissan leaf but the difference in range is more than double this is also due to other factors such as drag coefficient weight engine efficiency and rolling resistance musk stated that driving at 65 mph 105 kmh under normal conditions gives a reasonable range of 250 miles 400 km
the energy-saving sleep state powers off the display and other vehicle electronics after the car goes to sleep this increases the time it takes the touchscreen and instrument panel to become usable this mode can decrease the loss of the car's range when not being used 2.3 mi 3.7 km per day as of 2013update
the 85 kwh battery pack weighs 1200 lb 540 kg and contains 7104 lithium-ion battery cells in 16 modules wired in series 14 in the flat section and two stacked on the front each module contains 6 groups of 74 cells wired in parallel the 6 groups are then wired in series within the module as of june 2012update the battery pack used modified panasonic cells with nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathodes each cell was of the 18650 form factor ie an 18 mm diameter 65 mm height cylinder similar to the panasonic ncr18650b cell that has an energy density of 265 whkg analysts estimate battery cost to be around 21–22% of the car cost list price for a replacement battery was us$44000 in february 2015
the battery is guaranteed for eight years or 125000 miles 200000 km in metric countries for the base model with the 60 kwh battery pack the 85 kwh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles a poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss steadies around 5% after 30000 miles 50000 km decreasing further about 1% per additional 30000 miles unlike nissan tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss but some early battery packs have been replaced
a separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year at a cost of us$10000 for the 60 kwh battery and us$12000 for the 85 kwh battery
in 2013 tesla canceled a 40 kwh version of the car due to lack of demand stating that only 4% of pre-orders were for the 40 kwh battery option customers who ordered this option instead received the 60 kwh pack with charge software-limited to 40 kwh 139 miles 224 km it has the improved acceleration and top speed of the bigger pack and can be upgraded to use the full 60 kwh for us$11000
on april 8 2015 tesla motors discontinued the model s 60 and replaced the base model with the model s 70
in july 2015 tesla introduced its 70 90 90d and p90d variants along with a ludicrous mode for the performance model the p90d combines a front axle power of 259 horsepower 193 kw and rear axle power of 503 horsepower 375 kw to a total of 762 horsepower 568 kw for a 0–60 mph time of 2.8 sec the acceleration of the p90d can reach 1.1g described by tesla as faster than falling the ludicrous mode costs us$10000 for p90d but is discounted to us$5000 plus labor for p85d owners until january 2016
in 2015 tesla introduced a 70 kwh battery to replace the existing 60 kwh batteries and base 60 kwh model s vehicles as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers all 70 kwh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or all wheel drive
in july 2015 tesla introduced its 90 and p90d a range upgrade of the 85 variants with a 90 kwh battery and explained the 6% energy increase with improved cell chemistry and with the introduction of silicon into the graphite cell anode tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5% tesla also explained that apart from the p90d the model s has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1300 a and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts to reduce this uncertainty tesla has for the p90d introduced inconel battery contactors and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse which monitors the current at the millisecond level cuts the power with extreme precision and certainty and has a rating of 1500 a
in february 2016 the 85 kwh battery option was discontinued in countries including the usa australia and canada
in march 2016 media reported that a firmware version distributed for the tesla model s has support for a yet to come p100d variant ie a performance model with a 100 kwh battery and dual motors
under its five-cycle testing protocol the us environmental protection agency epa rated the 85 kwh model s model with a combined fuel economy equivalent of 89 mpge 2.64 l100 km with an equivalent 88 mpg-us 2.7 l100 km 106 mpg-imp in city driving and 90 mpg-us 2.6 l100 km 110 mpg-imp on highways
the following table shows the epa's official ratings for fuel economy in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpge and epa's estimated out-of-pocket fuel costs for the variants of the model s rated as of 30 december 2015update and as displayed in the monroney label
in contrast to most other battery electric vehicles including the roadster the battery pack of the model s forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles providing the vehicle with several advantages most notably since the battery pack is the single heaviest component of the vehicle the model s has a center of gravity height of only 18 inches 46 cm helping it to achieve a lateral acceleration of 0.9g and good protection against rollover secondly the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the mass to be centralized between the axles lowering rotational inertia allowing it to turn more quickly thirdly the placement of the battery pack increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment improving the passive safety of the vehicle fourth placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds either for maintenance or for tesla's battery swap service
the model s comes equipped with a different charger and connector in north american vs european markets reflecting differences in the local electric grid
in all markets the charge port is located behind a door in the left taillight during charging the charge port pulses green the frequency at which the charge port's light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches full when charging is complete the light stops pulsing and is solid green
the standard north american onboard charger accepts single phase 120 or 240-volt sources at a rate of up to 10 kw included adapters allow the car to charge from a standard 120 volt outlet a 240 volt nema 14-50 outlet and sae j1772 public chargers an optional us$2000 upgrade for a second 10 kw onboard charger supports a total of up to 20 kw charging from an 80 amp available us$750 tesla wall connector the north american connector uses a proprietary tesla design
charging times vary depending on the battery pack's state-of-charge its overall capacity the available voltage and the available circuit breaker amperage from a 120 volt15 amp household outlet the range increases by 3.75 miles 6 km for every hour of charging from a 10 kw nema 14–50 240 v50 a outlet like those used by rvs or standard cooking ranges the charge rate is 28.75 miles 46 km per hour using tesla's 20 kw 240 v high power wall connector increases the rate to 57 miles 92 km per hour if the car is configured with twin chargers 20 kw
the standard european charger accepts three phase 230 v or 400 v at up to 11 kw the type 2 connector on the car directly accepts mennekes iec 62196 charging from public stations at up to 400 v and included adapters allow the car to charge from standard continental european outlets and iec 60309 230 volt blue 3-pin or 400 volt red 5-pin outlets depending on region the addition of a second charger supports charging at up to 22 kw and the tesla wall connector was stated for be available from last-2015
tesla built 120 kw tesla supercharger stations to allow long distance travel in north america europe asia and australia a supercharger can add up to 125 miles 201 km of range in 20 minutes and a full charge in approximately one hour assuming a nearly empty 85 kwh battery
supercharging hardware is included in the 85 kwh 70 kwh and 60 kwh battery packs in both the 85 kwh models and 70 kwh models the payment for the car includes supercharging by default but in the 60 kwh supercharging was software-disabled and one must pay an extra fee to enable supercharging
the model s has independent coil spring suspension on all four wheels – front double wishbone virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink as an extra-cost option the car is available with self-leveling height-adjustable air suspension this is accomplished via adjustable bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver the car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase
because in the tesla electronic systems can be upgraded by over-the-air download rather than recall the suspension system has been changed retroactively on several occasions during the 2013 'fire investigation' nhtsa asked tesla to disable the car's ability to lower itself at speed on the theory that a ground clearance below 6 inches might cause the batteries underneath the car to contact road debris in september 2014 tesla upgraded the height adjustment feature for model s cars equipped with air suspension to remember locations that require higher clearance such as those with potholes and steep driveways and automatically adjusts to avoid them
beginning with vehicles manufactured in late september 2014 all new model s vehicles come equipped with a camera mounted at the top of the windshield forward looking radar in the lower grill and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors in the front and rear bumpers that provide a 360-degree buffer zone around the car this equipment allows model s to detect road signs lane markings obstacles and other vehicles in addition to adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning a us$2500 tech package option will allow this system to enable semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities new models sold since october 9 2014 have the option to have autopilot which allows hands-free driving in many situations autopilot-enabled cars receive software updates for the autopilot software wirelessly just as all other model s cars receive general software updates wirelessly
in mid october 2015 in the us tesla rolled out version 7 of their software that included autopilot capability on january 9 2016 tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update adding a new summon feature that allows cars to self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car
some industry experts have raised questions about the legal status of autonomous driving in the us and whether model s owner would violate current state regulations when using the autopilot function the few states that have passed laws allowing autonomous cars on the road limit their use for testing purposes not the use by the general public also there are questions about the liability for autonomous cars in case there is a mistake a tesla spokesman said there is nothing in our autopilot system that is in conflict with current regulations we are not getting rid of the pilot this is about releasing the driver from tedious tasks so they can focus and provide better input google's director of self-driving cars at the company said he does not think there is a regulatory block as far as the self-driving vehicle met crash-test and other safety standards a spokesman for the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa said that any autonomous vehicle would need to meet applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and the nhtsa will have the appropriate policies and regulations in place to ensure the safety of this type of vehicles
according to elon musk the model s was designed to be a computer on wheels we really designed the model s to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company a huge part of what tesla is is a silicon valley software company we view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop
according to musk the car will learn over time including from other cars
the instrument panel is a 12.3-inch 31 cm liquid-crystal display electronic instrument cluster that indicates speed power usage charge level estimated range and active gear as well as nav directions driven by garmin the gearbox can be set to drive neutral reverse and park the infotainment control touchscreen is a 17-inch 43 cm multi-touch panel divided into four areas a top line displays status symbols and provides shortcuts to charging homelink driver profiles vehicle information software version and the vehicle identification number and bluetooth the second line provides access to several apps including media nav driven by google maps and thus is separate from the nav on instrument panel energy web camera and phone the central main viewing area displays the two active apps subdivided into upper and lower areas most apps can be expanded to take up the entire area at the bottom is access to various controls and settings for the vehicle such as doors locks and lights as well as temperature controls and a secondary volume control
the instrument cluster and the infotainment panel are driven by separate nvidia tegra 3 3d visual computing modules tesla was the first company to ship this technology audi later delivered this technology in its 2013 model year in europe and in north america in 2014 the tegra system on a chip soc integrates eight specialized processors including a multi-core arm cpu a gpu and dedicated audio video and image processors nvidia claimed that it consumes 2% of the energy of a typical cpu
the navigation system uses gps and a mix of garmin and google maps route guidance the map display on the 17-inch screen requires a constant internet connection so navigation is limited in areas without mobile network coverage the nav on the instrument panel is loaded on the car and does not need internet access to function update 6.2 features automatic nav guidance to charging stations if range is insufficient
enthusiasts have developed the open vehicle monitoring system ovms which allows the owner to remotely observe a variety of different vehicle operating parameters such as battery state of charge typically using a smartphone some switchgear used are mercedes parts such as window switches cruise control lever and drive selector
according to elon musk the model s runs on the open-source linux operating system in 2014 autoblog reported that tesla models s owners had determined via the car's combined diagnostics and ethernet port that a ubuntu system controlling the central touchscreen is connected to the car's internal ethernet the same users determined that another ubuntu system controlling the dashboardnavigation screen also is connected to the internal network together with a third computer of unknown type with an unknown function
all versions of the model s have the same body and normally seat five passengers an optional folding third row for us$2500 becomes a rear-facing two-place child seat the option includes a stronger rear bumper each third row seat has a racing-style five-point harness for passengers over 37 in 0.94 m tall and weighing between 35 to 77 lb 16 to 35 kg cargo space is available under the front hood which tesla called a frunk a portmanteau of front trunk the optional third row gives the greatest passenger capacity of any electric vehicle in october 2014 the upgraded model s p85d d for dual was introduced the upgraded version features not one but two electric motors one driving the rear wheels as in prior versions and one the front wheels safety features are enhanced also for example with partial auto-pilot functions the dual motor version will be available also for the basic 85 kwh versions for around us$4000 more in price the rear wheel drive version of the p85 was removed and the dual motor option is not available for the 60 kwh version
the 2015 model year update introduced electromechanical brakes
the model s is covered by a 4-year 50000 mi 80000 km limited warranty that includes all standard equipment the transmission and the complete powertrain excluding tires the warranty can be extended an additional 4 years or 50000 miles 80000 km beyond the original terms for us$4000 warranty coverage includes a complementary loaner car—a performance 85 or tesla roadster—when service is required in april 2013 tesla announced that a previously mandatory us$600 annual vehicle inspection and maintenance fee would be made optional and would not be required to maintain warranty coverage if chosen the fee covers a complete inspection tire alignment new brake pads hardware upgrades and miscellaneous other maintenance items as needed
the battery and drive unit are covered for eight years or 125000 miles 200000 km in metric countries for the 60 kwh base model or eight years and unlimited distance for all 70 and 85 kwh models the unconditional battery warranty covers everything except deliberate damage even including user error however loss of battery capacity over time or usage is not covered under warrantyclarification needed
in february 2014 the automotive science group asg published the result of a study conducted to assess the life-cycle of over 1300 automobiles across nine categories sold in north america the study ranked the model s as the best environmental performer in the 2014 full-size cars category based on the assessment of life-cycle environmental footprint the study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the vehicle are more than offset with increased environmental performance during operation for the assessment the study used the average electricity mix of the us grid in 2014 the nissan leaf had the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the north american market
in 2012 tesla began building a network of 480-volt charging stations to facilitate long-distance travel in june 2013 tesla announced that existing and future stations would become tesla stations with facilities to support under-two-minute battery pack swaps as of early october 2014 115 stations were operating in the united states 71 in europe and 23 in asia the tesla network is usable only by tesla vehicles which are engineered for compatibility
the first supercharger corridor opened in october 2012 with six stations placed along routes connecting san francisco lake tahoe los angeles and las vegas a second corridor opened in december 2012 connecting washington dc new york city and boston it includes three stations located in highway rest areas in delaware and connecticut
the first tesla stations in europe opened in norway in august 2013 tesla next focused on germany and the netherlands with plans to cover both countries by mid-2014 switzerland belgium austria denmark and luxembourg were to be covered by the end of 2014 stations were to be within 200 mi 320 km for about 90% of the population in france england wales and sweden by the end of 2014
the supercharger is a proprietary dc rapid-charging station that provides up to 135 kw of power giving 85 kwh vehicles an additional 180 mi 290 km of range in about 30 minutes in the west coast corridor the superchargers's grid access is assisted by a solar carport system some including a battery of a few hundred kwh provided by solarcity eventually all tesla stations will be assisted by solar power
supercharging hardware is now a standard on all vehicles sold by tesla motors the roadster is not compatible in early november 2013 tesla reported that 90% of its customers had opted for supercharging capability
tesla designed its model s to allow fast battery swapping which also facilitates vehicle assembly in june 2013 tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station in tesla stations at a demonstration tesla showed a battery swap operation taking just over 90 seconds about half the time it takes to refill an empty gas tank
battery swapping was to be deployed along interstate 5 in california to allow travel from san francisco to los angeles these were to be followed by the washington dc to boston corridor each swapping station costs us$500000 and stocks about 50 batteries the service would be offered for the price of about 15 us gallons 57 l 12 imp gal of gasoline at the current local rate around us$60 to us$80 at june 2013 prices owners can pick up their original battery pack fully charged on the return trip which is included in the swap fee tesla would also offer the option to keep the swapped battery for a fee or to receive the original pack from tesla for a fee pricing has not been determined
tesla's only battery swap station is located at harris ranch california and was available for pilot testing in late december 2014 as of 2015update tesla says they have hundreds of cars in the battery swap program although few owners are interested in using the service in june 2015 tesla said that it was unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added due to lack of demand for battery swaps costing around $60 when supercharging is included free with most models
tesla allocated the first 1000 units to its signature and signature performance limited edition configurations equipped with the 85 kwh battery pack and priced in the us at us$95400 and us$105400 respectively not including any applicable us federal and local government tax credits and incentives as of july 2015update the base model s starts at us$75000 with a 70 kwh battery pack and goes up to us$105000 for the performance model with the 85 kwh pack before any government subsidies tesla does not make a convertible model s
a custom model s was designed for the oceanic preservation society in collaboration with obscura digital and was used to project images of endangered animals to help educate the public about the holocene mass extinction as featured in the 2015 documentary racing extinction
tesla motors reported 520 reservations for the model s during the first week they were available and as of 31 december 2012update over 15000 net reservations after deliveries and cancellations had been received by year-end the special edition model s signature model was sold out before deliveries began in june 2012 and according to tesla motors all models were sold out for that year shortly after a car ordered in may 2012 would be delivered in early to mid-2013
initially tesla expected to reach global sales of 35000 units in 2014 but in november 2014 reduced its sales target to 33000 units due to a deficit in production of 2000 units during the third quarter of 2014 the company expected its annual production to increase by over 50% in 2014 to 35000 units and another increase of 50% in 2015 tesla motors set a target of between 50000 and 52000 deliveries for model s and model x cars in 2015 and delivered 50658 units tesla plans to deliver 80000 to 90000 new model s and model x vehicles in 2016
2012
us deliveries began june 2012 deliveries of the 60 kwh model were rescheduled from november 2012 to januaryfebruary 2013 a total of 2650 cars were delivered in north america in 2012
2013
during the first six months of 2013 10050 were delivered the model s was released in europe in early august 2013 and the first deliveries took place in norway switzerland and the netherlands and by november 2013 the model s was on sale in 20 countries
sales totaled about 22477 units in north america and europe surpassing tesla's annual sales target of 21500 units global cumulative sales passed the 25000 unit milestone in december 2013 by the end of 2013 according to elon musk norway and switzerland became the company's largest per capita sales markets
2014
retail deliveries in china began in april 2014 the right-hand-drive model was released in the uk in june 2014 followed by hong kong in july 2014 and japan in september 2014 deliveries in australia began in december 2014

retail sales model
tesla motors sells its cars directly to consumers without creating a dealer network as other manufacturers have done and as many states require by legislation in support of its approach the company has fought legal and legislative battles in ohio new jersey new york and other states with law changes in recent years in new jersey new york maryland ohio and pennsylvania the tesla direct sales model is permitted in 22 states as of march 2015 as of may 2015update the sales procedure in other states such as texas is somewhat different with the tesla salesperson being prevented from discussing prices the actual sale having to be made online and the sales tax having to be paid up front delivery of a tesla car to a texas address is no different than in other states consequently while tesla showcases and sells its cars directly to the consumer in tesla stores abroad it operates a mix of tesla stores and tesla galleries in the usa

the model s is one of just a few cars to have ever achieved a 5-star safety rating from both euro ncap and the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa only two other cars have earned the same recognition since 2011 when the nhtsa introduced its latest rating schemeunreliable source?
the first widely reported model s fire occurred several minutes after the vehicle hit metal debris on the washington state route 167 highway in kent washington on october 1 2013 the driver was able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury he then contacted authorities and while awaiting their arrival smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle the driver stated that he hit something while exiting the hov lane tesla stated that the fire was caused by the direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 battery modules and that by design the modules were separated by firewalls limiting the fire to a small section in the front of the vehicle
the module was evidently punctured by a curved section that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident tesla stated that the debris punched a 3-inch 76 mm diameter hole through the .25-inch 6.4 mm armor plate under the vehicle applying force of some 25 tons built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment according to tesla the firefighters followed standard procedure using large amounts of water to extinguish the fire was correct however puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1% that of a conventional vehicle
on october 24 2013 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa announced after reviewing all available data the national highway traffic safety administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a tesla model s was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards but the following month the nhtsa opened a preliminary evaluation to determine the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 tesla model s vehicles on march 28 2014 nhtsa closed its investigation claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates along with increased ground clearance should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk
on november 6 2013 another fire broke out after a model s struck a tow hitch on the roadway causing damage beneath the vehicle the incidents led tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed
another fire incident took place in toronto canada in early february 2014 the model s was parked in a garage and was not charging when the fire started the origin of the fire is undetermined according to tesla in this particular case we don't yet know the precise cause but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery the charging system the adapter or the electrical receptacle as these components were untouched by the fire
starting with vehicle bodies manufactured as of 6 march 2014update all units were outfitted with a triple underbody shield existing cars were retrofitted upon request or as part of a normally scheduled service
on 1 january 2016 a 2014 model s caught fire in norway while supercharging unsupervised the vehicle was totally destroyed but nobody was injured the fire was slow and the owner had time to unplug the car and retrieve possesions an investigation by the norwegian accident investigation board aibn indicated that the fire originated in the car but was otherwise inconclusive in march 2016 tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the vehicle's distribution box but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause tesla stated that the supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated and a future model s software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected
on november 20 2015 tesla announced a voluntary worldwide recall of all of its 90000 model s vehicles in order to check for a possible defect in the cars' front seat belt assemblies the problem was raised in early november by one customer in europe tesla's resulting investigation was unable to identify a root cause for the failure and the company decided to examine every single car tesla reported that there have been no accidents or injuries related to the problem
as of august 2015update the distance record is 728.7 kilometres 452.8 mi in a model s on a single charge it was made by norwegian bjørn nyland and his friend on a flat stretch with low traffic around the supercharger in rødekro denmark they used hypermiling techniques such as front motor only low speed 39 kmh and no airconditioning the previous record was 425.8 miles 685.3 km made overnight on february 14 2013 by bruno bowden the first record of 423.5 miles 681.6 km was set during november 2012 by david and adam metcalf these attempts were inspired by a blog written by elon musk about the planned range and efficiency of the tesla model s offering a prize for anyone exceeding 400 miles 640 km on a single charge where it was estimated the 85 kwh model could do it by driving at a constant 36 mph 58 kmh under ideal conditions
on february 8 2013 the new york times published a review by john m broder about a trip between washington dc and boston using tesla's supercharger network at the time it included only two stations on the east coast broder made a variety of critical claims about the battery's performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations the trip ended with the model s carried by a flatbed truck to the milford connecticut station
tesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicle's charge levels and driving speed that contradicted broder's account on several factual details tesla implied that broder's behavior forced the car to fail broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with 19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels in the midst of the controversy a cnn reporter recreated broder's trip without exhausting the battery however two key differences distinguished the two journeys the weather was about 10 °f 6 °c warmer and cnn did the trip in one day the times let the car sit overnight without being plugged in a reporter from cnbc also recreated the trip in one day without incidents one week later a group of tesla owners recreated broder's trip without problems one owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two firmware updates
on february 18 2013 new york times public editor margaret sullivan published an editorial stating that broder took casual and imprecise notes of his test drive and did not use good judgment but she maintained that the article was done in good faith she also claimed that broder's vehicle logs were sometimes quite misleading
in july and september 2014 tests performed by an independent german car magazine in cooperation with the tüv german association for technical inspection and tesla owners seemed to reveal issues with the battery's performance according to the magazine tesla did not take up the invitation to repeat the test and also seemed to refuse to offer vehicles for a second test a test performed by another german publication die welt supported the findings
on august 19 2013 based on nhtsa safety ratings a tesla press release claimed that the model s had achieved the best safety rating of any car ever tested tesla stated nhtsa does not publish a star rating above 5 however safety levels better than 5 stars are captured in the overall vehicle safety score vss provided to manufacturers where the model s achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars however a few days later nhtsa rebutted tesla's claim explaining that the rating for the model s was equal to any other car receiving 5-stars and claiming that the carmaker did not follow its advertising guidelines
older versions of the system software suffered from power drain issues when the car wasn't being used with the batteries losing 4.5 kwh overnight known commonly as vampire drain system software v5.8 v1.49.30 released december 12 2013 reduced overnight energy loss substantially to 1.1 kwh per night or around 3 miles in january 2014 bjørn nyland a model s owner in norway recorded a range loss of approximately 20% during a 27-day extended vacation an indicated range loss of 63 miles 101 km or 2.3 miles 3.7 km per day while stored in frigid temperatures without any charging cable attached
in october 2015 two months after naming the tesla 'the best car ever tested' consumer reports declined to give the tesla model s a recommended designation citing too many complaints from owners complaints ranged from minor such as misaligned doors and squeaky body to severe - things like total drive train replacement and inoperable door handles tesla's shares dropped 15% both because of the magazine's cut and because of concerns over the tesla model x luxury suv
the p85d insane was widely reported to have 691 horsepower but some owners reported 20% less power on dynamometer in various circumstances
manufacturers are required by eu law to display power at full setting of the power controller from an external dc source when performing laboratory vehicle approval but not necessarily to show power limited by battery other equipment must be removed or their power added to the measurement actual power available depends on circumstances as it does for piston cars which until 1972 could be 25–30% less than given
as of november 2015update tesla website shows battery-limited combined 463 hp for p85d 532 hp for ludicrous
