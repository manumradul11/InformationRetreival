infrared thermography irt thermal imaging and thermal video are examples of infrared imaging science thermographic cameras usually detect radiation in the long-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum roughly 9000–14000 nanometers or 9–14 µm and produce images of that radiation called thermograms since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero according to the black body radiation law thermography makes it possible to see one's environment with or without visible illumination the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature when viewed through a thermal imaging camera warm objects stand out well against cooler backgrounds humans and other warm-blooded animals become easily visible against the environment day or night as a result thermography is particularly useful to the military and other users of surveillance cameras
some physiological changes in human beings and other warm-blooded animals can also be monitored with thermal imaging during clinical diagnostics thermography is used in allergy detection and veterinary medicine it is also used for breast screening though primarily by alternative practitioners as it is considerably less accurate and specific than competing techniques government and airport personnel used thermography to detect suspected swine flu cases during the 2009 pandemic
thermography has a long history although its use has increased dramatically with the commercial and industrial applications of the past fifty years firefighters use thermography to see through smoke to find persons and to localize the base of a fire maintenance technicians use thermography to locate overheating joints and sections of power lines which are a sign of impending failure building construction technicians can see thermal signatures that indicate heat leaks in faulty thermal insulation and can use the results to improve the efficiency of heating and air-conditioning units
the appearance and operation of a modern thermographic camera is often similar to a camcorder often the live thermogram reveals temperature variations so clearly that a photograph is not necessary for analysis a recording module is therefore not always built-in
non-specialized ccd and cmos sensors have most of their spectral sensitivity in the visible light wavelength range however by utilizing the trailing area of their spectral sensitivity namely the part of the infrared spectrum called near-infrared nir and by using off-the-shelf cctv camera it is possible under certain circumstances to obtain true thermal images of objects with temperatures at about 280 °c and higher
specialized thermal imaging cameras use focal plane arrays fpas that respond to longer wavelengths mid- and long-wavelength infrared the most common types are insb ingaas hgcdte and qwip fpa the newest technologies use low-cost uncooled microbolometers as fpa sensors their resolution is considerably lower than that of optical cameras mostly 160x120 or 320x240 pixels up to 1024×768 for the most expensive models thermal imaging cameras are much more expensive than their visible-spectrum counterparts and higher-end models are often export-restricted due to the military uses for this technology older bolometers or more sensitive models such as insb require cryogenic cooling usually by a miniature stirling cycle refrigerator or liquid nitrogen


thermal images or thermograms are actually visual displays of the amount of infrared energy emitted transmitted and reflected by an object because there are multiple sources of the infrared energy it is difficult to get an accurate temperature of an object using this method a thermal imaging camera is capable of performing algorithms to interpret that data and build an image although the image shows the viewer an approximation of the temperature at which the object is operating the camera is actually using multiple sources of data based on the areas surrounding the object to determine that value rather than detecting the actual temperature
this phenomenon may become clearer upon consideration of the formula
where incident radiant power is the radiant power profile when viewed through a thermal imaging camera emitted radiant power is generally what is intended to be measured transmitted radiant power is the radiant power that passes through the subject from a remote thermal source and reflected radiant power is the amount of radiant power that reflects off the surface of the object from a remote thermal source
this phenomenon occurs everywhere all the time it is a process known as radiant heat exchange since radiant power x time equals radiant energy however in the case of infrared thermography the above equation is used to describe the radiant power within the spectral wavelength passband of the thermal imaging camera in use the radiant heat exchange requirements described in the equation apply equally at every wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum
if the object is radiating at a higher temperature than its surroundings then power transfer will be taking place and power will be radiating from warm to cold following the principle stated in the second law of thermodynamics so if there is a cool area in the thermogram that object will be absorbing the radiation emitted by the warm object
the ability of objects to emit is called emissivity to absorb radiation is called absorptivity under outdoor environments convective cooling from wind may also need to be considered when trying to get an accurate temperature reading
the thermal imaging camera would next employ a series of mathematical algorithms since the camera is only able to see the electromagnetic radiation that is impossible to detect with the human eye it will build a picture in the viewer and record a visible picture usually in a jpg format
in order to perform the role of non-contact temperature recorder the camera will change the temperature of the object being viewed with its emissivity setting
other algorithms can be used to affect the measurement including the transmission ability of the transmitting medium usually air and the temperature of that transmitting medium all these settings will affect the ultimate output for the temperature of the object being viewed
this functionality makes the thermal imaging camera an excellent tool for the maintenance of electrical and mechanical systems in industry and commerce by using the proper camera settings and by being careful when capturing the image electrical systems can be scanned and problems can be found faults with steam traps in steam heating systems are easy to locate
in the energy savings area the thermal imaging camera can do more because it can see the effective radiation temperature of an object as well as what that object is radiating towards it can help locate sources of thermal leaks and overheated regions as well
emissivity is a term that is often misunderstood and misused it represents a material's ability to emit thermal radiation it is an optical property of matter
each material has a different emissivity which may vary by temperature and infrared wavelength for example clean metal surfaces have emissivity that decreases at longer wavelengths many dielectric materials such as quartz sio2 sapphire al2o3 calcium fluoride caf2 etc have emissivity that increases at longer wavelength simple oxides such as iron oxide fe2o3 display relatively flat emissivity in the infrared spectrum
a material's emissivity can range from a theoretical 0.00 completely not-emitting to an equally theoretical 1.00 completely emitting an example of a substance with low emissivity would be silver with an emissivity coefficient of .02 an example of a substance with high emissivity would be asphalt with an emissivity coefficient of .98
a black body is a theoretical object with an emissivity of 1 that radiates thermal radiation characteristic of its contact temperature that is if the contact temperature of a thermally uniform black body radiator were 50 °c the black body would emit thermal radiation characteristic of 50 °c
an ordinary object emits less infrared radiation than a theoretical black body the fraction of its actual emission to the theoretical emission of the black body is its emissivity or emissivity coefficient
in order to make a temperature measurement of an object using an infrared imager it is necessary to estimate or determine the object's emissivity for quick work a thermographer may refer to an emissivity table for a given type of object and enter that value into the imager the imager would then calculate the object's contact temperature based on the value entered from the table and the object's emission of infrared radiation as detected by the imager
in order to get a more accurate temperature measurement a thermographer may apply a standard material of known high emissivity to the surface of the object the standard material might be as complex as industrial emissivity spray produced specifically for the purpose or as simple as standard black insulation tape with an emissivity of about 0.97 the object's known temperature can then be measured using the standard emissivity if desired the object's actual emissivity on a part of the object that is not covered by the standard material can then be determined by adjusting the imager's setting to the known temperature there are situations however when such an emissivity test is not possible due to dangerous or inaccessible conditions in these situations the thermographer must rely on tables
ir film is sensitive to infrared ir radiation in the 250 °c to 500 °c range while the range of thermography is approximately −50 °c to over 2000 °c so for an ir film to work thermographically it must be over 250 °c or be reflecting infrared radiation from something that is at least that hot usually infrared photographic film is used in conjunction with an ir illuminator which is a filtered incandescent source or ir diode illuminator or else with an ir flash usually a xenon flash that is ir filtered these correspond with active near-ir modes as discussed in the next section
night vision infrared devices image in the near-infrared just beyond the visual spectrum and can see emitted or reflected near-infrared in complete visual darkness however again these are not usually used for thermography due to the high temperature requirements but are instead used with active near-ir sources
starlight-type night vision devices generally only magnify ambient light
all objects above the absolute zero temperature 0 k emit infrared radiation hence an excellent way to measure thermal variations is to use an infrared vision device usually a focal plane array fpa infrared camera capable of detecting radiation in the mid 3 to 5 μm and long 7 to 14 μm wave infrared bands denoted as mwir and lwir corresponding to two of the high transmittance infrared windows abnormal temperature profiles at the surface of an object are an indication of a potential problem
in passive thermography the features of interest are naturally at a higher or lower temperature than the background passive thermography has many applications such as surveillance of people on a scene and medical diagnosis specifically thermology
in active thermography an energy source is required to produce a thermal contrast between the feature of interest and the background the active approach is necessary in many cases given that the inspected parts are usually in equilibrium with the surroundings
active illumination couples imaging intensification technology with an active source of illumination in the near infrared nir or shortwave infrared swir band examples of such technologies include low light cameras
active infrared night-vision combines infrared illumination of spectral range 700–1000 nm just below the visible spectrum of the human eye with ccd cameras sensitive to this light the resulting scene which is apparently dark to a human observer appears as a monochrome image on a normal display device because active infrared night-vision systems can incorporate illuminators that produce high levels of infrared light the resulting images are typically higher resolution than other night-vision technologies active infrared night vision is now commonly found in commercial residential and government security applications where it enables effective night time imaging under low-light conditions however since active infrared light can be detected by night-vision goggles there can be a risk of giving away position in tactical military operations
laser range gated imaging is another form of active night vision which utilizes a high powered pulsed light source for illumination and imaging range gating is a technique which controls the laser pulses in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera's detectors gated imaging technology can be divided into single shot where the detector captures the image from a single light pulse and multi-shot where the detector integrates the light pulses from multiple shots to form an image one of the key advantages of this technique is the ability to perform target recognition rather than mere detection as is the case with thermal imaging
thermal imaging cameras convert the energy in the infrared wavelength into a visible light display all objects above absolute zero emit thermal infrared energy so thermal cameras can passively see all objects regardless of ambient light however most thermal cameras only see objects warmer than −50 °c
the spectrum and amount of thermal radiation depend strongly on an object's surface temperature this makes it possible for a thermal imaging camera to display an object's temperature however other factors also influence the radiation which limits the accuracy of this technique for example the radiation depends not only on the temperature of the object but is also a function of the emissivity of the object also radiation originates from the surroundings and is reflected in the object and the radiation from the object and the reflected radiation will also be influenced by the absorption of the atmosphere
thermography by definition is by means of an instrument artifact but some living creatures have natural organs that function as counterparts to bolometers and thus possess a crude type of thermal imaging capability thermoception one of the best known examples is infrared sensing in snakes
