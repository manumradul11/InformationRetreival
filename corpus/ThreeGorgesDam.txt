the three gorges dam is a hydroelectric dam that spans the yangtze river by the town of sandouping located in yiling district yichang hubei province china the three gorges dam is the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity 22500 mw in 2014 the dam generated 98.8 twh of electricity setting a new world record by 0.17 twh previously held by the itaipú dam on the brazilparaguay border in 2013 of 98.63 but in 2015 the itaipu power plant resumed the lead in annual worldwide production producing 89.5 twh while production of three gorges was 87 twh 
except for a ship lift the dam project was completed and fully functional as of july 4 2012 when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production the ship lift was complete in december 2015 each main water turbine has a capacity of 700 mw the dam body was completed in 2006 coupling the dam's 32 main turbines with two smaller generators 50 mw each to power the plant itself the total electric generating capacity of the dam is 22500 mw
as well as producing electricity the dam is intended to increase the yangtze river's shipping capacity and reduce the potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space the chinese government regards the project as a historic engineering social and economic success with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions however the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3 million people and is causing significant ecological changes including an increased risk of landslides the dam has been a controversial topic both domestically and abroad


a large dam across the yangtze river was originally envisioned by sun yat-sen in the international development of china in 1919 he stated that a dam capable of generating 30 million horsepower 22 gw was possible downstream of the three gorges in 1932 the nationalist government led by chiang kai-shek began preliminary work on plans in the three gorges in 1939 japanese military forces occupied yichang and surveyed the area a design the otani plan was completed for the dam in anticipation of a japanese victory over china
in 1944 the united states bureau of reclamation chief design engineer john l savage surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the 'yangtze river project' some 54 chinese engineers went to the us for training the original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next in the case of smaller water craft groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency it is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods some exploration survey economic study and design work was done but the government in the midst of the chinese civil war halted work in 1947
after the 1949 communist takeover mao zedong supported the project but began the gezhouba dam project nearby first and economic problems including the great leap forward and the cultural revolution slowed progress after the 1954 yangtze river floods in 1956 mao zedong authored swimming a poem about his fascination with a dam on the yangtze river in 1958 after the hundred flowers campaign some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned
during the 1980s the idea of a dam reemerged the national people's congress approved the dam in 1992 out of 2633 delegates 1767 voted in favour 177 voted against 664 abstained and 25 members did not vote construction started on december 14 1994 the dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009 but additional projects such as the underground power plant with six additional generators delayed full operation until may 2012verification needed the ship lift was completed in 2015 the dam had raised the water level in the reservoir to 172.5 m 566 ft above sea level by the end of 2008 and the designed maximum level of 175 m 574 ft by october 2010
made of concrete and steel the dam is 2335 m 7661 ft long and the top of the dam is 185 metres 607 ft above sea level the project used 27.2 million cubic metres 35.6×10 ^6 cu yd of concrete mainly for the dam wall 463000 tonnes of steel enough to build 63 eiffel towers and moved about 102.6 million cubic metres 134.2×10 ^6 cu yd of earth the concrete dam wall is 181 metres 594 ft high above the rock basis
when the water level is at its maximum of 175 metres 574 ft above sea level which is 110 metres 361 ft higher than the river level downstream the dam reservoir is on average about 660 kilometres 410 mi in length and 1.12 kilometres 3700 ft in width it contains 39.3 km3 31900000 acre·ft of water and has a total surface area of 1045 square kilometres 403 sq mi on completion the reservoir flooded a total area of 632 square kilometres 244 sq mi of land compared to the 1350 square kilometres 520 sq mi of reservoir created by the itaipu dam
the government estimated that the three gorges dam project would cost 180 billion yuan us$22.5 billion by the end of 2008 spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan among which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents and 15.195 billion yuan on financing it is estimated that the construction cost will be recovered when the dam has generated 1000 terawatt-hours 3600 pj of electricity yielding 250 billion yuan full cost recovery is expected to occur ten years after the dam starts full operation
funding sources include the three gorges dam construction fund profits from the gezhouba dam loans from the china development bank loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks corporate bonds and revenue before and after the dam is fully operational additional charges were assessed as follows every province receiving power from the three gorges dam has to pay ¥7.00 per mwh extra other provinces had to pay an additional charge of ¥4.00 per mwh the tibet autonomous region pays no surcharge
power generation is managed by china yangtze power a listed subsidiary of china three gorges corporation ctgc — a central enterprise soe administered by sasac the three gorges dam is the world's largest capacity hydroelectric power station with 34 generators 32 main generators each with a capacity of 700 mw and two plant power generators each with capacity of 50 mw making a total capacity of 22500 mw among those 32 main generators 14 are installed in the north side of the dam 12 in the south side and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam the expected annual electricity generation will be over 100 twh
the main generators weigh about 6000 tonnes each and are designed to produce more than 700 mw of power the designed head of the generator is 80.6 meters 264 ft the flow rate varies between 600–950 cubic metres per second 21000–34000 cu fts depending on the head available the greater the head the less water needed to reach full power three gorges uses francis turbines turbine diameter is 9.710.4 m vgs designalstom's design and rotation speed is 75 revolutions per minute rated power is 778 mva with a maximum of 840 mva and a power factor of 0.9 the generator produces electrical power at 20 kv the outer diameter of the generator stator is 21.420.9 m the inner diameter is 18.518.8 m the stator the biggest of its kind is 3.13 m in height bearing load is 50505500 tonnes average efficiency is over 94% and reaches 96.5%
the generators are manufactured by two joint ventures one of them includes alstom abb group kvaerner and the chinese company haerbin motor the other includes voith general electric siemens abbreviated as vgs and the chinese company oriental motor the technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract most of the generators are water-cooled some newer ones are air-cooled which are simpler in design and manufacture and are easier to maintain
the 14 north side main generators are in operation the first no 2 started on july 10 2003 the north side became completely operational september 7 2005 with the implementation of generator no 9 full power 9800 mw was only reached on october 18 2006 after the water level reached 156 m
the 12 south side main generators are also in operation no 22 began operation on june 11 2007 and no 15 started up on october 30 2008 the sixth no 17 began operation on december 18 2007 raising capacity to 14.1 gw finally surpassing itaipu 14.0 gw to become the world's largest hydro power plant by capacity
the 6 underground main generators are also in operation as of may 23 2012 when the last main generator no 27 finished its final test raising capacity to 22.5 gw after 9 years of construction installation and testing the power plant is now fully operational
by august 16 2011 the plant had generated 500 twh of electricity in july 2008 it generated 10.3 twh of electricity its first month over 10 twh on june 30 2009 after the river flow rate increased to over 24000 m3 all 28 generators were switched on producing only 16100 mw because the head available during flood season is insufficient during an august 2009 flood the plant first reached its maximum output for a short period
during the november to may dry season power output is limited by the river's flow rate as seen in the diagrams on the right when there is enough flow power output is limited by plant generating capacity the maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site assuming the water level is 175 m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15% the actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid
the three gorges dam reached its design-maximum reservoir water level of 175 m 574 ft for the first time on october 26 2010 in which the intended annual power-generation capacity of 84.7 twh was realized in 2012 the dam's 32 generating units generated a record 98.1 twh of electricity which accounts for 14% of china's total hydro generation
the state grid corporation and china southern power grid paid a flat rate of ¥250 per mwh us$35.7 until july 2 2008 since then the price has varied by province from ¥228.7–401.8 per mwh higher-paying customers receive priority such as shanghai nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam
power distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about 34.387 billion yuan construction was completed in december 2007 one year ahead of schedule
power is distributed over multiple 500 kilovolt kv transmission lines three direct current dc lines to the east china grid carry 7200 mw three gorges – shanghai 3000 mw hvdc three gorges – changzhou 3000 mw and hvdc gezhouba – shanghai 1200 mw the alternating current ac lines to the central china grid have a total capacity of 12000 mw the dc transmission line hvdc three gorges – guangdong to the south china grid has a capacity of 3000 mw
the dam was expected to provide 10% of china's power however electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected even fully operational on average it supports only about 1.7% of electricity demand in china in the year of 2011 when the chinese electricity demand reached 4692.8 twh
according to the national development and reform commission of china 366 grams of coal would produce 1 kwh of electricity during 2006 at full power three gorges reduces coal consumption by 31 million tonnes per year avoiding 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions millions of tonnes of dust one million tonnes of sulfur dioxide 370000 tonnes of nitric oxide 10000 tonnes of carbon monoxide and a significant amount of mercury hydropower saves the energy needed to mine wash and transport the coal from northern china
from 2003 to 2007 power production equaled that of 84 million tonnes of standard coal reducing carbon dioxide by 190 million tonnes sulfur dioxide by 2.29 million tonnes and nitrogen oxides by 980000 tonnes
the dam increased the yangtze's barge capacity sixfold reducing carbon dioxide emission by 630000 tonnes from 2004 to 2007 a total of 198 million tonnes of goods passed through the ship locks compared to using trucking barges reduced carbon dioxide emission by ten million tonnes and lowered costs by 25%
two hazards are uniquely identified with the dam one is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon and the other is that the dam sits on a seismic fault at current levels 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion depositing about 40 million tons of sediment into the yangtze annually because the flow is slower above the dam much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream and there will be less sediment downstream
the absence of silt downstream has three effects
erosion in the reservoir induced by rising water causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface including two incidents in may 2009 when somewhere between 20000 and 50000 cubic metres 26000 and 65000 cu yd of material plunged into the flooded wuxia gorge of the wu river also in the first four months of 2010 there were 97 significant landslides
the dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around chongqing and its suburban areas according to the ministry of environmental protection as of april 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84 million tonnes per day 65% of the total need about 32 landfills were added which could handle 7664.5 tonnes of solid waste every day over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created this has left the water looking stagnant polluted and murky
in 1997 the three gorges area had 10% forestation down from 20% in the 1950s
research by the united nations food and agriculture organization research suggested that the asia-pacific region would overall gain about 6000 square kilometers of forest by 2008 that is quite a turnaround from the 13000 square kilometers net loss of forest each year in the 1990s the main reason is china's huge reforestation effort this accelerated after the 1998 yangtze river floods convinced the government that it must restore tree cover especially in the yangtze's basin upstream of the three gorges dam
concerns about the potential wildlife impact of the dam predate the national people's congress's approval in 1992 this region has long been known for its rich biodiversity it is home to 6388 species of plants which belong to 238 families and 1508 genera of these plant species 57 percent are endangered these rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional chinese medicines already the percentage of forested area in the region surrounding the three gorges dam has dropped from twenty percent in 1950 to less than ten percent as of 2002 negatively affecting all plant species in this locality the region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime many other fish are hurt in the turbine blades of the hydroelectric plants as well this is particularly detrimental to the ecosystem of the region because the yangtze river basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for twenty-seven percent of all endangered freshwater fish species in china other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam particularly the baiji or chinese river dolphin now extinct in fact government chinese scholars even claim that the three gorges dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji
of the 3000 to 4000 remaining critically endangered siberian crane a large number currently spend the winter in wetlands that will be destroyed by the three gorges dam the dam contributed to the functional extinction of the baiji yangtze river dolphin though it was close to this level even at the start of construction the dam further decreased its habitat and increased ship travel which are among the factors causing what will be its ultimate demise in addition populations of the yangtze sturgeon are guaranteed to be negatively affected by the dam
an important function of the dam is to control flooding which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the yangtze millions of people live downstream of the dam with many large important cities like wuhan nanjing and shanghai situated adjacent to the river plenty of farm land and china's most important industrial area are built beside the river
the reservoir's flood storage capacity is 22 cubic kilometres 18000000 acre·ft this capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every ten years to once every 100 years the dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a super flood in 1954 the river flooded 193000 km2 74518 sq mi killing 33169 people and forcing 18884000 people to move the flood covered wuhan a city of eight million people for over three months and the jingguang railway was out of service for more than 100 days the 1954 flood carried 50 cubic kilometres 12 cu mi of water the dam could only divert the water above chenglingji leaving 30 to 40 km3 7.2 to 9.6 cu mi to be diverted also the dam cannot protect against some of the large tributaries downstream including the xiang zishui yuanshui lishui hanshui and the gan
in 1998 a flood in the same area caused billions of dollars in damage 2039 km2 787 sq mi of farm land were flooded the flood affected more than 2.3 million people killing 1526 in early august 2009 the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site the dam limited the water flow to less than 40000 cubic metres 52000 cu yd per second raising the upstream water level from 145.13 metres on august 1 2009 to 152.88 on august 8 2009 4.27 cubic kilometres of flood water were captured and the river flow was cut by as much as 15000 cubic metres per second
the dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season between december and march every year this increases the flow rate of the river downstream and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage it also improves shipping conditions the water level upstream drops from 175 m to 145 m preparing for the rainy season the water also powers the gezhouba dam downstream
since the filling of the reservoir in 2003 the three gorges dam has supplied an extra 11 cubic kilometres of fresh water to downstream cities and farms during the dry season
during the 2010 south china floods in july inflows at the three gorges dam reached a peak of 70000 m3s 2500000 cu fts exceeding the peak during the 1998 yangtze river floods the dam's reservoir rose nearly 3 m 9.8 ft in 24 hours and reduced the outflow to 40000 m3s 1400000 cu fts in discharges downstream effectively alleviating serious impacts on the middle and lower river
the installation of ship locks is intended to increase river shipping from ten million to 100 million tonnes annually as a result transportation costs will be cut between 30 and 37% shipping will become safer since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate ships with much deeper draft will be able to navigate 2400 kilometres 1500 mi upstream from shanghai all the way to chongqing it is expected that shipping to chongqing will increase fivefold
there are two series of ship locks installed near the dam 30°50′12″n 111°1′10″e﻿  ﻿30.83667°n 111.01944°e﻿  30.83667 111.01944 each of them is made up of five stages with transit time at around four hours maximum vessel size is 10000 tons the locks are 280 m long 35 m wide and 5 m deep 918 × 114 × 16.4 ft that is 30 m longer than those on the st lawrence seaway but half as deep before the dam was constructed the maximum freight capacity at the three gorges site was 18.0 million tonnes per year from 2004 to 2007 a total of 198 million tonnes of freight passed through the locks the freight capacity of the river increased six times and the cost of shipping was reduced by 25% the total capacity of the ship locks is expected to reach 100 million tonnes per year
these locks are staircase locks whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate and lower gate the gates are the vulnerable hinged type which if damaged could temporarily render the entire flight unusable as there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks
in addition to the canal locks there is a ship lift a kind of elevator for vessels the ship lift can lift ships of up to 3000 tons the vertical distance traveled is 113 metres and the size of the ship lift's basin is 120×18×3.5 metres the ship lift takes 30 to 40 minutes to transit as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks one complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically the ship lift must work even if water levels vary by 12 meters 39 ft on the lower side and 30 metres on the upper side
the ship lift was not yet complete when the rest of the project was officially opened on may 20 2006 in november 2007 it was reported in the local media that construction of the ship lift started in october 2007
in february 2012 xinhua reported that the four towers that are to support the ship lift had almost been completed
the report said the towers had reached 189 metres of the anticipated 195 metres the towers would be completed by june 2012 and the entire shiplift in 2015
as of may 2014 the ship lift was expected to be completed by july 2015 it was tested in december 2015 and announced complete in january 2016
plans also exist for the construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam area altogether two short rail lines one on each side of the river are to be constructed the 88 kilometer long northern portage railway 北岸翻坝铁路 will run from the taipingxi port facility 太平溪港 on the northern side of the yangtze just upstream from the dam via yichang east railway station to the baiyang tianjiahe port facility in baiyang town 白洋镇 below yichang the 95 kilometer long southern portage railway 南岸翻坝铁路 will run from maoping upstream of the dam via yichang south railway station to zhicheng on the jiaozuo–liuzhou railway
in late 2012 preliminary work started along both future railway routes
as of june 2008 china relocated 1.24 million residents ending with gaoyang in hubei province as 13 cities 140 towns and 1350 villages either flooded or were partially flooded by the reservoir a_2-mcr3-1hps-15 about 1.5% of the province's 60.3 million and chongqing municipality's 31.44 million population about 140000 residents were relocated to other provinces
relocation was completed on july 22 2008 some 2007 reports claimed that chongqing municipality will encourage an additional four million people to move away from the dam to the main urban area of chongqing by 2020 however the municipal government explained that the relocation is due to urbanization rather than the dam and people involved included other areas of the municipality
allegedly funds for relocating 13000 farmers around gaoyang disappeared after being sent to the local government leaving residents without compensation
the 600 km 370 mi long reservoir flooded some 1300 archaeological sites and altered the appearance of the three gorges as the water level rose over 300 ft 91 m cultural and historical relics are being moved to higher ground as they are discovered but the flooding inevitably covered undiscovered relics some sites could not be moved because of their location size or design for example the hanging coffins site high in the shen nong gorge is part of the cliffs
the united states department of defense reported that in taiwan proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to china's urban population or high-value targets such as the three gorges dam will deter chinese military coercion
the notion that the military in taiwan would seek to destroy the dam provoked an angry response from the mainland chinese media people's liberation army general liu yuan was quoted in the china youth daily saying that the people's republic of china would be seriously on guard against threats from taiwan independence terrorists
days after the first filling of the reservoir around 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam's structure the submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the glen canyon dam in the us state of arizona which was unable to properly withstand the colorado river floods of 1983 however 163000 concrete units of the three gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits an experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating
in order to maximize the utility of the three gorges dam and cut down on sedimentation from the jinsha river the upper course of the yangtze river authorities plan to build a series of dams on the jinsha including wudongde dam baihetan dam along with the now completed xiluodu and xiangjiaba dams the total capacity of those four dams is 38500 mw almost double the capacity of the three gorges baihetan is preparing for construction and wudongde is seeking government approval another eight dams are in the midstream of the jinsha and eight more upstream of it
