the timeline of historic inventions is a chronological list of particularly important or significant technological inventions and the people who created the inventions
note dates for inventions are often controversial inventions are often invented by several inventors around the same time or may be invented in an impractical form many years before another inventor improves the invention into a more practical form where there is ambiguity the date of the first known working version of the invention is used here


note that all dates refer to the earliest known evidence of an invention dates are often approximate and likely to change as more research is done and older examples of any given technology are found similarly the locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence to date has been found but in most cases there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention actually first took place
note the shift from ma and ka to bc and ad â€“ 8000 bc is approximately the same as 10 ka
