the toyota prius ˈpriːəs is a full hybrid electric mid-size hatchback formerly a compact sedan developed and manufactured by toyota the united states environmental protection agency and california air resources board carb rate the prius as among the cleanest vehicles sold in the united states based on smog-forming emissions the 2016 model year prius eco ranks as the all-time most fuel efficient gasoline-powered car available in the us without plug-in capability
the prius first went on sale in japan in 1997 and was available at all four toyota japan dealerships making it the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle it was subsequently introduced worldwide in 2000 the prius is sold in over 90 markets with japan and the united states being its largest markets global cumulative prius liftback sales reached the milestone 1 million vehicle mark in may 2008 2 million in september 2010 and passed the 3 million mark in june 2013 cumulative sales of 1 million priuses were achieved in the us by early april 2011 and japan reached the 1 million mark in august 2011 global sales of the prius c variant passed the 1 million mark during the first half of 2015
in 2011 toyota expanded the prius family to include the prius v an extended hatchback wagon and the prius c a subcompact hatchback the production version of the prius plug-in hybrid was released in 2012 the prius family totaled global cumulative sales of 5.2 million units in july 2015 representing 65.4% of the 8 million hybrids sold worldwide by toyota since 1997


prius is a latin word meaning first original or superior according to toyota the name was chosen because the prius was launched before environmental awareness became a mainstream social issue
in february 2011 toyota asked the public to decide on what the most proper plural form of prius should be with choices including prien prii prium prius or priuses the company said it would use the most popular choice in its advertising and on 20 february announced that prii was the most popular choice and the new official plural designation in latin prius is the neuter singular of the comparative form prior prior prius of an adjective with only comparative and superlative the superlative being primus prima primum consequently like all third declension words the plural in latin was priora cf latin declension which was used by the lada priora in 2007
despite the official plural form used by toyota priuses remains good english and is the more frequently used plural form
beginning in september 2011 toyota usa began using the following names to differentiate the original prius from some newer members of the prius family the standard prius became the prius liftback the prius v known as the prius α in japan and prius + in europe the prius plug-in hybrid and the prius c called toyota aqua in japan
in 1995 toyota debuted a hybrid concept car at the tokyo motor show with testing following a year later the first prius model nhw10 went on sale on 10 december 1997 it was available only in japan though it has been imported privately to at least the united states united kingdom australia and new zealand
the first generation prius at its launch became the world's first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car at its introduction in 1997 it won the car of the year japan award and in 1998 it won the automotive researchers' and journalists' conference car of the year award in japan
uk sales of the first generation prius began on 19 october 2000
production commenced in december 1997 at the takaoka plant in toyota aichi ending in february 2000 after cumulative production of 37425 vehicles production recommenced in may 2000 at the motomachi plant in the same area before xw10 manufacture ended in june 2003 after a further 33411 vehicles had been produced
the nhw10 prius styling originated from california designers who were selected over competing designs from other toyota design studios
in the united states the nhw11 was the first prius to be sold the prius was marketed between the smaller corolla and the larger camry the published retail price of the car was us$19995 the nhw11 prius became more powerful partly to satisfy the higher speeds and longer distances that americans drive air conditioning and electric power steering were standard equipment the vehicle was the second mass-produced hybrid on the american market after the two-seat honda insight while the larger prius could seat five its battery pack restricted cargo space
the us epa carb classified the car with an air pollution score of 3 out of 10 as an ultra low emission vehicle ulev prius owners were eligible for up to a us$2000 federal tax deduction from their gross income in contrast with the nw10 toyota executives stated that the company broke even financially on sales of the nhw11 prius
european sales began in september 2000 the official launch of the prius in australia occurred at the october 2001 sydney motor show although sales were slow until the nhw20 xw20 model arrived toyota sold about 123000 first generation priuses
presented at the 2003 new york international auto show for the 2004 us model year the prius was completely redesigned it became a mid-size liftback sized between the corolla and the camry with redistributed mechanical and interior space significantly increasing rear-seat legroom and luggage room the new prius is even more environmentally friendly than the previous model according to the epa and is 6 inches 150 mm longer than the previous version its more aerodynamic kammback body balances length and wind resistance resulting in a drag coefficient of cd0.26 the development effort led by chief engineer shigeyuki hori led to 530 patents for the vehicle
production commenced in august 2003 at the tsutsumi plant in toyota aichi supplemented in october 2004 with the fujimatsu plant at kariya aichi
the prius uses an all-electric ac compressor for cooling an industry first combined with a smaller and lighter nimh battery the xw20 is more powerful and more efficient than the xw10 in the us the battery pack of 2004 and later models is warranted for 150000 miles 240000 km or 10 years in states that have adopted the stricter california emissions control standards and 100000 miles 160000 km or 8 years elsewhere the warranty for hybrid components is 100000 miles 160000 km or 8 years
it is classified as a sulev super ultra low emissions vehicle and is certified by california air resources board as an advanced technology partial zero emission vehicle at-pzev
from 2005 to 2009 the second generation prius had been built by faw-toyota in the city of changchun for the chinese market it was reported that a total of 2152 priuses were sold in 2006 and 414 in 2007 the relatively low sales was blamed on high price about us$15000 higher than the equivalent in japan or the us caused by high duties on imported parts in early march 2008 toyota cut the price of prius by up to eight percent or us$3000 to cn¥259800 us$36500 it was thought that the sales dropped as a result of both a lack of acceptance and increased competition the honda civic hybrid was exported to china from 2007 toyota sold about 1192000-second generation priuses worldwide
us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa crash testing of the 2004 us model year prius yielded a five-star driver and four-star passenger rating in the frontal-collision test out of five stars side crash results were four out of five stars for both front and rear seats the car scored four out of five stars in rollover testing
us insurance institute for highway safety crash tests scored the prius good overall in frontal collisions and good overall in side-impact collisions in models equipped with side airbags a poor score was given to models without side airbags side curtain and torso airbags became standard on 2007 american models
toyota debuted the new prius 2010 us model year at the january 2009 north american international auto show and sales began in japan on 18 may 2009 toyota cut the price of the prius from ¥2.331 million to ¥2.05 million to better compete with the honda insight leading some to wonder whether increased sales of the prius might come at the expense of sales of other vehicles with higher margins competition from lower priced hybrids such as the honda insight also made it difficult for toyota to capitalize on the prius's success as of june 2013update toyota has sold about 1688000 third-generation priuses worldwide
at its introduction in 2009 it won the car of the year japan award for the second time
its new body design is more aerodynamic with a reduced drag coefficient of cd0.25 this figure is disputed by general motors which found the value for the model with 17-inch wheels to be around 0.30 based on tests in gm ford and chrysler wind tunnels car & driver measured the 3rd generation prius at 0.26 in a privately arranged 5-way wind-tunnel test of comparable cars an underbody rear fin helps stabilize the vehicle at higher speedscitation needed
the estimated fuel-efficiency rating using the us epa combined cycle is 50 mpg-us 4.7 l100 km 60 mpg-imp the prius was the most efficient car powered by liquid fuel available in the us in 2009 based on the official rating only the first-generation honda insight 2000–2006 equipped with a manual transmission attained a lower fuel consumption rate the official uk fuel efficiency data for the prius t3 is urban 72.4 mpg-imp 3.90 l100 km 60.3 mpg-us extra urban 76.4 mpg-imp 3.70 l100 km 63.6 mpg-us combined 72.4 mpg-imp 3.90 l100 km 60.3 mpg-us
the 1.8-liter gasoline engine previously 1.5 liters generates 98 hp 73 kw and with the added power of the electric motor generates a total of 134 hp 100 kw previously 110 hp or 82 kw the larger engine displacement allows for increased torque reducing engine speeds rpm which improves fuel economy at highway speeds thanks to its electric water pump the prius engine is the first consumer automotive production engine that requires no accessory belts which also further improves its fuel economy the electric motors and other components of the hybrid powertrain are also smaller and more efficient than the industry average toyota estimates the new inverter motor and transaxle are 20 percent lighter
in constructing the prius toyota used a new range of plant-derived ecological bioplastics made out of cellulose derived from wood or grass instead of petroleum the two principal crops used are kenaf and ramie kenaf is a member of the hibiscus family a relative to cotton and okra ramie commonly known as china grass is a member of the nettle family and one of the strongest natural fibres with a density and absorbency comparable to flax toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the united nations' international year of natural fibres which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others
to create the third-generation prius for 2010 toyota engineers revisited just about everything to eke out further efficiencies a new front-drive platform underpinned the car although the wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre weight-saving aluminum was employed in the hood rear hatch front axle and brake calipers disc brakes were finally assigned to all four wheels
in december 2013 consumer reports named the prius as the best value for the second year in a row
high trim levels in the third generation prius include features like softex trim seats that look and feel just like leather but are lighter in weight headlight washers parking sensors premium jbl speaker system and electrically operated lumbar support adjustment for the driver's seat
in mid-2011 for the 2012 model year the third-generation prius liftback received modest style and equipment changes the exterior changes include updated headlamps revised tail lamps plus a distinctive front fascia and bumper and the deletion of the super white color option in the united states prospective american prius buyers wanting a white exterior must either choose the blizzard pearl color a metallic off-white for an additional $220 or choose another make or model the prius can be equipped with an updated infotainment system featuring the optional toyota entune suite of connectivity features other updates include a 6.1-inch touch-screen an amfm cd player unit a usb port for ipod connectivity an auxiliary input jack a bluetooth hands-free phone capability and streaming audio the prius also includes an optional solar panel on the roof of the car solely to power a ventilation fan while the car is parked to keep the interior cooler in sunny conditions for the us market only the prius two three four and five were offered the premium prius five model's advanced technology package includes the premium hdd navigation system plus the head-up display dynamic radar cruise control pre-collision system and lane keep assist the pre-collision system retracts the front seatbelts and applies the brakes in certain conditions when it determines that a crash is unavoidable lane keep assist can help the driver stay within the lane the us 2012 model year includes toyota's vehicle proximity notification system vpns which emits an artificial engine noise to alert pedestrians the blind and others of the vehicle's presence due to significant noise reduction typical of a hybrid vehicle traveling at low speeds in all-electric mode
the fourth generation prius was first shown during september 2015 in las vegas and was released for retail customers in japan in december 2015 the launch in north american market is scheduled for january 2016 and february in europe toyota expects to sell 12000 fourth generation prius cars a month in japan and to reach annual sales between 300000 to 350000 units
in august 2013 toyota managing officer satoshi ogiso who was chief engineer for the prius line announced some of the improvements and key features of the next generation prius the next prius is the first vehicle to use the toyota new global architecture tnga modular platform which provides a lower center of gravity and increased structural rigidity these features along with other improvements allow for gains in ride-and-handling agility and aerodynamics the improved aerodynamics contribute to an all-new exterior design which includes a roomier interior
the next-generation prius was designed to deliver significantly improved fuel economy in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost these objectives were achieved through the development of a new generation of powertrains with significant advances in battery electric motor and gasoline engine technologies the next prius features improved batteries with higher energy density smaller electric motors with higher power density than the current prius motors and the gasoline engine features a thermal efficiency greater than 40% in the current prius is 38.5% the prius fuel economy has improved on average by about 10% each generation and toyota has set the challenge to continue to improve at this rate
under the japanese test toyota expects the fourth generation prius to achieve a fuel economy rating of 40.8 kml 115 mpg-imp 96 mpg-us the 2016 model year prius has an official epa fuel economy rating of 54 mpg-us 4.4 l100 km 65 mpg-imp for city 50 mpg-us 4.7 l100 km 60 mpg-imp for highway and 52 mpg-us 4.5 l100 km 62 mpg-imp for combined driving the new eco version available in mid-grade level two trim which features lithium-ion batteries has an official epa rating of 58 mpg-us 4.1 l100 km 70 mpg-imp city 53 mpg-us 4.4 l100 km 64 mpg-imp highway and 53 mpg-us 4.4 l100 km 64 mpg-imp combined this improved efficiency is largely due to the reduced weight of the eco which has a lighter battery and does not carry a spare tire
in terms of combined fuel economy the 2016 prius eco equals the 2000 first generation honda insight as the most fuel efficient car available in the us without plug-in capability however the honda insight still achieves highway mpg of 61 mpg-us 3.9 l100 km 73 mpg-imp which is higher than the prius 53 mpg highway rating 
the new prius is 2.4 in 6.1 cm longer 0.6 in 1.5 cm wider and 0.8 in 2.0 cm lower at the rear a double wishbone independent suspension replaces its predecessors torsion beam the front uses standard led headlamps toyota has claimed that the fourth-generation prius would have a drag coefficient of cd0.24 better than the 0.25 claimed for the third-generation model
ogiso also explained that the next-generation prius plug-in hybrid vehicle was developed in parallel with the standard prius model toyota is developing a new wireless or inductive charging system that produces resonance between an on-floor coil and an onboard coil to transmit power to the battery the company plans to begin testing of the wireless battery charging system in japan the us and europe in 2014 for a future plug-in prius toyota is also considering requests from prius phv owners for additional all-electric range
the prius plug-in hybrid zvw35 is based on the conventional third generation zvw30 with a 4.4-kwh lithium-ion battery that allows an all-electric range of 23 km 14.3 mi a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began in late 2009 and took place in japan europe canada china australia new zealand and the united states
the production version was unveiled at the september 2011 frankfurt motor show deliveries began in japan in late january 2012 followed by a limited roll-out in the us in late february deliveries began in europe in june 2012 and in the uk in august 2012 during its first year in the market global sales reached 27181 prius phvs making the prius phv the second top selling plug-in electric car in 2012 after the chevrolet volt as of november 2015update about 75000 units have been sold worldwide the united states is the market leader with 42271 units delivered through november 2015 followed by japan with 21657 units sold through july 2015 as of november 2015update the prius plug-in ranks as the world's third top selling plug-in hybrid after the voltampera family of vehicles and the mitsubishi outlander p-hev
production of the first generation prius plug-in hybrid ended in june 2015 the next-generation prius plug-in is being developed in parallel with the standard fourth generation prius model scheduled to be released by december 2015 the second generation plug-in variant has no official release date announced but according to automotive news production of the new plug-in version is expected to begin in about october 2016
at the january 2011 north american international auto show toyota revealed the 2012 model year prius v an extended hatchback wagon which is derived from the third-generation prius and features over 50 percent more interior cargo space than the original prius design
in may 2011 toyota introduced the prius α alpha in japan which is available in a five-seat two-row model and a seven-seat three-row model the latter's third row enabled by a space-saving lithium-ion drive battery in the center console the five-seat model uses a nimh battery pack the alpha is the basis for the five-seat prius v launched in north america in october 2011 with a nickel-metal hydride battery pack similar to the 2010 model year prius and with two rows of seats to accommodate five passengers the european and japanese versions are offered with a lithium-ion battery with three rows of seats with accommodations for seven passengers the european version named prius+ plus began deliveries in june 2012 global sales totaled 582379 units as of july 2015update japan is the main market with 401600 units sold followed by north america with 142711 units and europe with 32735
toyota unveiled the prius c concept at the january 2011 north american international auto show the prius c has a lower list price and is smaller than the current prius hatchback the production version was unveiled at the 2011 tokyo motor show as the toyota aqua and was launched in japan in december 2011 the prius c was released in the us and canada in march 2012 and in april 2012 in australia and new zealand the prius c is not available in europe where instead toyota is selling the toyota yaris hybrid since june 2012 the prius c and the yaris hybrid share the same powertrain the aqua ranked as the second best selling car in japan in 2012 after the prius brand as toyota reports together sales of the conventional prius and the prius α when sales of these two prius models are broken down the toyota aqua ranked as the top selling model in japan including kei cars with the aqua leading monthly sales since february through december 2012 in addition for two consecutive years 2013 and 2014 the aqua was the top selling new car in japan the aqua is considered the most successful nameplate launch in japan in the last 20 years
global sales of the aquaprius c passed the 500000 mark in august 2013 and the 1 million milestone during the first half of 2015 as of july 2015update with 1081332 units sold worldwide the aquaprius c is the second top selling tmc hybrid after the regular prius the top market is japan with 901465 aquas sold capturing a 83.4% of global sales followed by the united states with 140720 units
the prius is sold in over 90 countries and regions worldwide cumulative sales of the prius passed the 1 million mark in may 2008 exceeded 2 million units in september 2010 and reached the 3 million milestone in june 2013 as of july 2015update global sales of the prius family totaled 5.264 million units representing 65.4% of the 8.048 million hybrids delivered by toyota motor company tmc worldwide including the lexus brand sales of the prius family are led by the prius liftback with 3.5 million units followed by the aquaprius c with 1.08 million the prius +vα with 582.4 thousand and the prius plug-in hybrid with 73.6 thousand units
as of april 2011 the us accounted for almost half of prius liftback global sales with 1 million priuses sold since 2000 however the prius experienced two consecutive years of sales decreases from its peak in 2007 falling to 139682 units in 2009 before rebounding to 140928 units in 2010 sales in japan reached 1 million priuses in august 2011 as of july 2015update sales of the prius liftback in both japan and the us had exceeded the 1.5 million mark
cumulative prius sales in europe reach 100000 in 2008 and 200000 units by mid-2010 after 10 years on that market the uk is one of the leading european markets for prius accounting more than 20 percent of all priuses sold in europe toyota prius became japan's best selling vehicle in 2009 for the first time since its debut in 1997 as its sales almost tripled to 208876 in 2009 in that year it overtook the honda fit which was japan's best-selling car in 2008 excluding kei cars
rising oil prices caused by the arab spring led to increased sales of the prius in the first quarter of 2011 but the 2011 tōhoku earthquake and tsunami led to a production stoppage production restarted several days later but output was hindered due to shortages from parts suppliers nevertheless during the 2011 japanese fiscal year 1 april 2011 through 31 march 2012 the prius family sold 310484 units including sales of the prius α launched in may 2011 and the toyota aqua launched in december allowing the prius brand to become the best-selling vehicle in japan for the third-consecutive year until september 2012 the prius liftback was the top selling new car in japan for 16 months in a row until it was surpassed by the toyota aqua in october which kept the lead through december 2012 the prius liftback with 317675 units sold in 2012 including sales of the prius α was the best selling car in japan during the 2012 calendar year for the fourth consecutive year the aqua ranked as the second best selling car with 266567 units sold in 2012 nevertheless when sales of the two prius models are broken down the toyota aqua ranked as the top selling model in japan in 2012 including kei cars leading sales since february through december 2012 the aqua was the top selling new car in japan in 2013 and again in 2014 global prius sales peaked in 2010 with over 500 thousand units sold and since 2011 sales of the liftback version have declined in most markets through december 2014 and in the us and canada since 2013
high gasoline prices in the us approaching us$4 a gallon by march 2012 contributed to record monthly sales of the prius family vehicles a total of 28711 units were sold in the united states during march 2012 becoming the one-month record for prius sales ever the third-generation prius liftback accounted for 18008 units 62.7% the prius v accounted for 4937 units 17.2% the prius c for 4875 units 17.0% and the prius plug-in hybrid for 891 units 3.1% another record was set during the first-quarter of 2012 with prius family sales of 60859 units it became the best selling quarter ever sales of toyota prius family vehicles in california represented 26% of all prius purchases in the us during 2012 with 60688 units sold during this year the prius became the best selling vehicle in california ahead of the previous leader the honda civic 57124 units and the third ranked the toyota camry 50250 units the prius nameplate was again in 2013 the best selling vehicle in california with 69728 units sold in the state ahead of the honda civic 66982 and the honda accord 63194
toyota sold 223905 priuses among the various hev family members in the us in 2012 representing together a market share of 51.5% of all hybrid sold in the country that year in addition a total of 12750 prius phvs were sold in 2012 allowing the plug-in hybrid to rank as the second top selling plug-in electric car in the us after the chevrolet volt and surpassing the nissan leaf the toyota prius liftback with 147503 units sold was the best selling hybrid in 2012 the prius v ranked third with 40669 units and the prius c was fourth with 35733 units toyota usa estimated that sales of its hybrids models in 2012 would represent 14% of total toyota sales in the country since their inception in 1999 a total of 1.5 million prius family members have been sold in the us by mid october 2013 representing a 50.1% market share of total hybrid sales in the country of these 1356318 are conventional prius liftbacks sold through september 2013
prius family sales also set a record in japan in march 2012 accounting for the conventional prius and prius α sales a total of 45496 units were sold in march 2012 becoming the highest monthly sales ever for any model in japan since 1997 and representing a market share of 9% of all new car registrations excluding kei cars the toyota aqua sold 29156 units ranking as the third top selling car that month together all prius family vehicles sold 74652 units representing 15% of monthly new car sales in march 2012 with a total of 247230 vehicles sold during the first quarter of 2012 the toyota prius family became the third top selling nameplate in the world in terms of total global sales after the toyota corolla 300800 units and the ford focus 277000 units
the following table presents retail sales of the other vehicles of the prius family by year since deliveries began in 2011 through july 2015
the prius is a power-split or series-parallel full hybrid sometimes referred to as a combined hybrid a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline andor electric power wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.25 0.29 for 2000 model with a kammback design to reduce air resistance lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction an electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts in the us and canada a vacuum flask is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time the prius engine makes use of the atkinson cycle
when the vehicle is turned on with the power button it is ready to drive immediately with the electric motor in the second generation prius electric pumps warm the engine by pumping previously saved hot engine coolant from a coolant thermos before the internal combustion engine is started the delay between powering the car on and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds the third generation prius does not have a coolant thermos instead the engine is heated by recapturing exhaust heat a button labelled ev maintains electric vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than 25 mph 40 kmh this permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption for journeys under 1 mile 1.6 km the car automatically reverts to normal mode if the battery becomes exhausted prior to the 2010 model the north american model did not have the ev button although the ev mode is still supported internally by the prius hybrid vehicle management computercitation needed
there are two principal battery packs the high voltage hv battery also known as the traction battery and a 12 volt battery known as the low voltage lv battery the traction battery is a sealed 38-module nickel metal hydride nimh battery pack providing 273.6 volts 6.5 a·h capacity and weighing 53.3 kg 118 lb is supplied by japan's panasonic ev energy co they are normally charged between 40–60% of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as allow headroom for regenerative braking each battery pack uses 10–15 kg 22–33 lb of lanthanum and each prius electric motor contains 1 kg 2 lb of neodymium production of the car is described as the biggest user of rare earths of any object in the world the lv battery is essential to starting the car providing initial power to the computer
the second generation prius contains a 1.310kwh battery composed of 28 modules each battery module is made of 6 individual 1.2v 6.5ah prismatic nimh cells in series forming a 7.2v 6.5ah module with 46whkg energy density and 13 kwkg output power density each module contains an integrated charge controller and relay these modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6v 6.5ah battery traction battery also known as the energy storage system the computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60% by shallow cycling the battery only a small portion of its net available energy storage capacity is available for use approximately 400wh by the hybrid drive system but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life thermal management control and net long term calendar life of the battery active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design
as the prius reached ten years of being available in the us market in february 2011 consumer reports decided to look at the lifetime of the prius battery and the cost to replace it the magazine tested a 2002 toyota prius with over 200000 miles on it and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 prius with 2000 miles tested by consumer reports 10 years before the comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration overall fuel economy of the 2001 model was 40.6 miles per us gallon 5.79 l100 km 48.8 mpg-imp while the 2002 prius with high mileage delivered 40.4 miles per us gallon 5.82 l100 km 48.5 mpg-imp the magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run the cost of replacing the battery varies between us$2200 and us$2600 from a toyota dealer but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around us$500 one study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries
since its inception the toyota prius has been among the best fuel economy vehicles available in the united states and for the model year 2012 the prius family has three models among the top 10 most fuel-efficient cars sold in the country as rated by us environmental protection agency epa after the honda insight first generation was discontinued in september 2006 the prius liftback became the most fuel-efficient car sold in the american market until it was topped by the chevrolet volt in december 2010 as the plug-in hybrid was rated by epa with an overall combined cityhighway gasoline-electricity fuel economy of 60 mpg-us 3.9 l100 km 72 mpg-imp equivalent mpg-e according to the epa for the model year 2012 and when only gasoline-powered vehicles are considered excluding all-electric cars the prius c ranks as the most fuel-efficient compact car the prius liftback as the most fuel-efficient midsize car and the prius v as the most fuel-efficient midsize station wagon
more fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than a conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this
the following table presents fuel economy performance and carbon emissions for all prius family models sold in japan since 1997 the ratings are presented for both the current official 10-15 mode cycle test and the new jc08 test designed for japan's new standards that goes into effect in 2015 but it is already being by several car manufacturers for new cars the prius 2nd generation became the first car to meet japan's new 2015 fuel economy standards measured under the jc08 test
in 2008 the british government and british media have requested that toyota release detailed figures for the energy use and co2 emissions resulting from the building and disposal of the prius toyota has not supplied the requested data details to address statements that the lifetime energy usage of the prius including the increased environmental cost of manufacture and disposal of the nickel-metal hydride battery is outweighed by lower lifetime fuel consumption toyota states that lifetime co2 saving is 43 percent as of 2010 the uk government car service runs over 100 priuses the largest part of its fleet and lists the prius as having the lowest co2 emissions among its fleet
cnw marketing research initially published a study in which they estimated that the total lifetime energy cost of a 2005 prius was greater than that of a hummer h2 the study is widely cited but its contents have also been widely debunked see for example hummer versus prius 'dust to dust' report misleads the media and public with bad science
the prius uses electric motors in the hybrid propulsion systems powered by a high voltage battery in the rear of the car there has been some public concern over whether the levels of electromagnetic field exposure within the cabin are higher than comparable cars and what health effects those fields may present popularized by a 2008 the new york times article however toyota and several independent studies have indicated that aside from a brief spike when accelerating the electromagnetic fields within the prius are no different from those of a conventional car and do not exceed the icnirp exposure guidelines
a 2013 study by the mayo clinic found that patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators can safely drive or ride in hybrids or plug-in electric cars without risk of electromagnetic interference emi the research was conducted using implantable devices from the three major manufacturers and a 2012 toyota prius hybrid the study used 30 participants with implanted devices and measured electric and magnetic fields in six positions inside and outside the prius and each position was evaluated at different speeds
the wall street journal reported in february 2007 on concerns that quiet cars like the prius may pose a safety risk to those who rely on engine noise to sense the presence or location of moving vehicles blind pedestrians are a primary concern and the national federation of the blind advocates audio emitters on hybrid vehicles but it has been argued that increased risks may also affect sighted pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles however silent vehicles are already relatively common and there is also a lack of aural cues from vehicles that have a conventional internal combustion engine where engine noise has been reduced by noise-absorbing materials in the engine bay and noise-canceling muffler systems in july 2007 a spokesman for toyota said the company is aware of the issue and is studying options
in 2010 toyota released a device for the third-generation prius meant to alert pedestrians of its proximity japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in january 2010 and the us approved legislation on december 2010 models equipped with automatically activated systems include all 2012 and later model year prius family vehicles that have been introduced in the united states including the standard prius the prius v the prius c and the toyota prius plug-in hybrid the warning sound is activated when the car is traveling at less than 15 mph 24 kmh and cannot be manually turned off

in the uk the advertising standards authority an independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry ruled that a television advert for the toyota prius should not be broadcast again in the same form having breached rules concerning misleading advertising the advertisement stated that the prius emits up to one tonne less co2 per year while on-screen text included 1 tonne of co2 less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine average calculated on 20000 km a year points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison whether 'up to' one tonne less adequately communicated that reductions could be lower and whether the distance used was appropriate 20000 km per year is around a us car's average annual driving distance while a uk car's is 13440 km
the large number of prius-owning progressive celebrities in 2002 prompted the washington post to dub hybrids hollywood's latest politically correct status symbol conservatives called prius patriots also drive the cars because they want to contribute to reduce us dependence on foreign oil a 2007 san francisco chronicle article said prius progressives were becoming an archetype with american conservative commentator rush limbaugh opining that these liberals think they're ahead of the game on these things and they're just suckers
in july 2007 the new york times published an article using data from cnw marketing research finding that 57% of prius buyers said their main reason for buying was that it makes a statement about me while just 37% cited fuel economy as a prime motivator shortly afterwards washington post columnist robert samuelson coined the term prius politics to describe a situation where the driver's desire to show off is a stronger motivator than the desire to curb greenhouse gas emissions some conservatives promote use of the toyota prius and other hybrid cars for example jim road from what would jesus drive? encouraged people to drive hybrid cars because of the damage that large suvs and faster cars can do to others
former central intelligence agency cia chief r james woolsey jr drives a prius because of its low fuel consumption woolsey noted the volatility of the middle east coupled with anti-us sentiment in much of the region noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the middle east gives vast profits to middle eastern regimes woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles in a motor trend magazine article woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-qaeda meaning that americans who buy inefficient vehicles would in effect be indirectly funding terrorism we're paying for both sides in this war and that's not a good long-term strategy said woolsey i have a bumper sticker on the back of my prius that reads 'bin laden hates this car'
