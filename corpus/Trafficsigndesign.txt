traffic sign design involves any tasks in the process of designing traffic signage traffic signs may provide information about the law warn about dangerous conditions and guide roadway users traffic signs vary depending upon their use using different symbols colors and shapes for easy identification


regulatory signs give a direction that must be obeyed often these signs show content or action that is either allowed or prohibited and these two modes are signified by colour ie green and red orientation ie open circle and circle with diagonal line through the centre andor shape
ie square and triangle
warning signs give a warning of that there are dangerous or unusual conditions ahead often these signs have a greater more conspicuous presence than a regulatory sign these signs often do not have much text on them as they should be internationally understood due to the nature of the message that they are conveying
information signs give information about direction and distance usually guiding drivers to destinations facilities services and attractions often these signs have names of locations with an arrow pointing towards the direction of the destination and a number giving the approximate distance
these non-permanent temporary signs are erected to warn drivers of unexpected conditions such as road work zones diversions detours lane closures and traffic control often these signs are portable and can also be digital variable message signs
when designing traffic signs it is recommended to follow the four basic steps of interaction design identifying needs and establishing user requirements developing alternative designs building interactive versions evaluating the designs
drivers cyclists pedestrians and other types of pedestrians are the users that will be interacting with traffic signs these users are using the roadways for transportation purposes and must receive information about the roadways and their destinations as they are traveling
this task is divided into two categories conceptual design and physical design conceptual design will be the discussion of alternative traffic signs and ways of conveying information to the users physical design will be the discussion of what physical aspects ie colour shape orientation will be on the sign to convey the messages identified during the conceptual design
this task is the actual building of traffic signs these can be prototypes of a very low or very high fidelity
this task is the testing of the prototypes and actual signs in order to determine if they convey the desired message in the desired time by the appropriate users this will let the users know the usability of their signs
traffic sign comprehension and understandability are higher when the signs comply with ergonomic principles it is recommended to follow the below principles in order to increase driver comprehension and understandability
the matching between the physical symbols on a sign with the literal directionsinformation the sign is trying to convey the physical arrangement in space relative to the position of information and directions 
the correct association between the physical symbols on a sign and the information the sign is trying to convey good conceptual compatibility means that a driver will know the meaning of a symbol without having to reflect and interpret its meaning
the similarity between the information that is being represented and the actual content on a sign good physical representation means that a driver will experience what is shown on a sign
the frequency that which a sign appears will determine how familiar it is to drivers good frequency means that the sign is used often and that the meaning of its contents is well known
the extent to which any sign can be grouped into a type of sign with similar or equal shape colour and orientation good standardization means that all signs of the same type have the same template of shape colour and orientation ideally standardization should be across cities regions and countries
the representation of only a single meaning for a single sign good singular functionality means that a sign that gives information should not also imply a regulatory meaning or another piece of related information
the extent to which any sign can be seen it should be visible by drivers of all age groups from an appropriate distance that will allow the driver to react to the signs contents visibility also means that the sign has enough contrast with the background to be conspicuous and that the contents on the sign have enough contrast with the background of the sign to be conspicuous
it has been shown that following these principles when designing traffic signs will make the signs more comprehensible minimizing the time and effort it takes drivers to interpret traffic signs may help to reduce driver mental workload and frustration it is also especially important to attempt to follow the standardization principle because due to the increase in globalization many drivers may be visiting internationally it is also particularly important to follow the principle of visibility because of the increasing average age and thus vision difficulties of drivers
