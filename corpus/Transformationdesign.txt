in broad terms transformation design is a human-centered interdisciplinary process that seeks to create desirable and sustainable changes in behavior and form – of individuals systems and organizations – often for socially progressive ends
it is a multi-stage iterative process applied to big complex issues – often social issues
its practitioners examine problems holistically rather than reductively to understand relationships as well as components to better frame the challenge they then prototype small-scale systems – composed of objects services interactions and experiences – that support people and organizations in achievement of a desired change successful prototypes are then scaled
because transformation design is about applying design skills in non-traditional territories it often results in non-traditional design outputs.3 projects have resulted in the creation of new roles new organizations new systems and new policies these designers are just as likely to shape a job description as they are a new product.3
this emerging field draws from a variety of design disciplines - service design user-centered design participatory design concept design information design industrial design graphic design systems design interactive design experience design - as well as non-design disciplines including cognitive psychology and perceptual psychology linguistics cognitive science architecture haptics information architecture ethnography storytelling and heuristics


though academics have written about the economic value of and need for transformations over the years78 its practice first emerged in 2004 when the design council the uk’s national strategic body for design formed red a self-proclaimed do-tank challenged to bring design thinking to the transformation of public services.1
this move was in response to prime minister tony blair’s desire to have public services redesigned around the needs of the user the patients the passenger the victim of crime3
the red team led by hilary cottam studied these big complex problems to determine how design thinking and design techniques could help government rethink the systems and structures within public services and possibly redesign them from beginning to end.3
between 2004 and 2006 the red team in collaboration with many other people and groups developed techniques processes and outputs that were able to transform social issues such as preventing illness managing chronic illnesses senior citizen care rural transportation energy conservation re-offending prisoners and public education
in 2015 braunschweig university of art  germany will start a new ma in transformation design
transformation design like user-centered design starts from the perspective of the end user designers spend a great deal of time not only learning how users currently experience the system and how they want to experience the system but also co-creating with them the designed solutions
because transformation design tackles complex issues involving many stakeholders and components more expertise beyond the user and the designer is always required people such as but not limited to policy makers sector analysts psychologists economists private businesses government departments and agencies front-line workers and academics are invited to participate in the entire design process - from problem definition and solution development.6
with so many points-of-view brought into the process transformation designers are not always ‘designers’ instead they often play the role of moderator though varying methods of participation and co-creation these moderating designers create hands-on collaborative workshops aka charrette that make the design process accessible to the non-designers
ideas from workshops are rapidly prototyped and beta-tested in the real world with a group of real end users their experience with and opinions of the prototypes are recorded and fed back into the workshops and development of the next prototype
