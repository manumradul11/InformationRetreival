transition design proposes design led societal transition towards more sustainable futures it applies an understanding of the interconnectedness of social economic political and natural systems to address problems that exist at all levels of scale in ways that improve quality of life such complex and interconnected wicked problems can include poverty and economic inequality biodiversity loss decline of community resource depletion pollution and climate change
transition design leverages the power of interdependency and symbiosis with the aim of transforming entire lifestyles making these more convivial and participatory and harmonising them with the natural environment it emphasizes the temporal element of all such design solutions — how they relate to the traditional and vernacular cultures of the past and how they might unfold develop and connect over short medium and long horizons of time
transition design aims to intervene in social economic political and technological systems so as to assist people to satisfy their needs in ways that establish mutually beneficial relationships between people the natural environment and the built and designed world this process is informed in particular by living systems theory employing such concepts as self-organization interdependence emergence holarchy and phase transition it involves changing the ways in which people earn their livelihood and changing the organization of business manufacturing agriculture finance healthcare education and travel transition design aims to cultivate lifestyles and forms of everyday life in which fundamental needs can be satisfied in integrated place-based ways encouraging symbiotic relationships between communities and between communities and their ecosystems


transition designers can come from all walks-of-life and backgrounds regardless of whether they are formally trained designers they use the tools and processes of design to re-conceive entire lifestyles rather than focusing on problems within existing mostly unsustainable social economic and political paradigms designers assume a similar role in transition design as they do in service design or social design the designer is a facilitator of emergent solutions to problems rather than an expert who conceives and delivers blueprints and finished solutions transition designers are especially focussed on potentialities for beneficial change that exist within systems and on making modest interventions which can ramify throughout entire systems
because complex wicked problems are multi-faceted their solutions require not only the skills and knowledge of designers but also knowledge from the spectrum of disciplinary fields science philosophy psychology social science anthropology and the humanities etc transition design is therefore a collaborative process that is informed by knowledge from outside design it emphasizes the need for transdisciplinarity and for the reintegration of knowledge
transition design solutions however should not simply represent the collaborative efforts of groups of experts and specialists since solutions must be place-specific and ecosystem appropriate they must incorporate local knowledge participation and commitment just as transition design solutions need not only represent the reintegration of knowledge they should also represent its recontextualization just as engineering has been used as a metaphor to describe the large scale top-down and managerial influence of social phenomena designer urban planner technocrat and policy maker as social engineers so the transition designer might be compared to a gardener like a good gardener the transition designer has an intimate understanding of and feeling for a particular place and its ecosystem of the relationships between its different parts of what its particular needs are of what will and will not flourish and of how it might grow and develop over long periods of time
in designing for the relationship between people nature and the things that people make and do in designing for short mid and long horizons of time and in acknowledgement of vernacular historical and indigenous cultures and in designing placeecosystem specific solutions transition design can be seen as a logical development of a trend in design over recent decades that emphasizes relationship and context within mainstream design this trend has included service design or design for service social design or design for social innovation and interaction design whilst outside of mainstream design this trend has included permaculture and ecological design
in the school of design at carnegie mellon university cmu transition design is taught alongside design for service and design for social innovation in the expectation that designers will be able to move freely between these three areas of practice and research according to the scope of the problem that they hope to address thus design for service represents moderate change within existing paradigms and systems design for social innovation represents significant change within emerging paradigms and systems and transition design represents radical change within future paradigms and systems
these areas of design practise and research can be located on a continuum and the movement along this continuum from design for service through design for social innovation to transition design represents an expansion of the scale of time depth of engagement and context to include social political economic and environmental concerns transition design’s foregrounding of relationship context and wholeness represents the incorporation into design of an ecological or holistic worldview and gives it several defining features
professor terry irwin head of the school of design at carnegie mellon university with dr cameron tonkinwise director of design studies and chair of the doctoral program at carnegie mellon university and dr gideon kossoff adjunct professor in the school of design at carnegie mellon university have together developed a framework which organizes transition design into four mutually influencing areas vision for transition theories of change posturemindset and new ways of designing this framework was first disseminated at a talk given by irwin kossoff and tonkinwise at 'head heart hand' the 2013 national aiga design conference in minneapolis
transition design acknowledges that we are living in ‘transitional times’ its central premise is the need for societal transitions to more sustainable futures and the belief that design has a key role to play in these transitions the use of the word ‘transition’ is suggested and reinforced by several contemporary discourses projects and networks in various ways these initiatives explore how changetransition manifests and can be initiated and directed or are actively engaged in trying to bring about transition to more sustainable futures such initiatives have influenced transition design in several ways and include
transition towns an international network of communities who are working to develop local resilience and expand their capacity to respond to and 'bounce back' from external disruptions — crises such as an interruption to energy supplies economic downturns or climate change transition towns are for example developing locally based food and energy systems and local currencies and businesses by corollary transition design involves a type of social engagement and community organizing that situates projects and initiatives within the context of long-term visions for specific places and ecosystems
socio-technical transition management a body of theory which represents the convergence of sustainable development research technology forecasting social ecological impact analysis and the fields of social history and construction of technology it studies the coevolution of technologies and their uses in order to conceive how innovations can be introduced into society to enable new ways of living and working recently it has incorporated social practice theory and is beginning explicit use of ideas about designing by corollary transition design should involve a deep understanding of the social history of technology and a post-planning approach to how the introductions of new technologies impact society and vice versa
the great transition was a term first used in 1964 by the economist and systems theorist kenneth boulding in 1995 the global scenario group began to produce a series of reports identifying multiple future-based planetary scenarios and various strategies for change that could lead to the ‘great transition’ improved quality of life reduced poverty and inequity human solidarity enriched cultures and protection of the biosphere in recent years the tellus institute has launched the great transition initiative gti an international network of more than 40 scholars and activists who seek to develop and mobilize a planet-wide citizens transition movement the concept of the ‘great transition’ has also been adopted by several leading think tanks such as the new economics foundation by corollary transition design future based scenarios and the means and tools by which local communities can transition towards these within a planetary context
the concept of ‘transition’ in transition design alludes to the dynamic nature of complex non-linear self-organizing and interdependent systems such as ecosystems and organisms the 'phase transition' that occurs as such systems undergo stresses or ‘perturbations’ from their environment can lead them to display unexpected unpredictable and ‘emergent’ new forms of behaviour and structure by corollary transition design incorporates living systems theoryecoliteracy in order to prepare designers for work within complex social systems and to understand how these are embedded in natural systems transition design leverages the potential for self-organization interdependence and emergence within such non-linear systems and anticipates the possibility of rapid systemic change that can be triggered by modest interventions
transition design focuses on the need for cosmopolitan localism a place-based lifestyle in which solutions to global problems are designed for local circumstances and tailored to specific social and ecological contexts its objective is to foster a global network of mutually supportive communities neighbourhoods villages towns cities and regions who share and exchange knowledge ideas skills technology culture and where socially and ecologically sustainable resources cosmopolitan localism fosters a creative reciprocal relationship between the local and the global it addresses the problem of globalisation which tends to subsume local cultures and economies into homogenised and unsustainable global systems whilst avoiding the pitfalls of localisation such as parochialism and isolationism
the concept of transition design was first developed by gideon kossoff in a chapter called 'holism and the reconstitution of everyday life a framework for the transition to a sustainable society' in the book grow small think beautiful ideas for a sustainable world from schumacher college edited by stephan harding this chapter was a summary of kossoff’s phd thesis also entitled holism and the reconstitution of everyday life 2011 the term 'transition design' has since been adopted by the carnegie mellon school of design and incorporated into its curriculum as one of three areas within which design is taught and researched at the undergraduate graduate and doctoral levels design for service design for social innovation and transition design
in his phd thesis holism and the reconstitution of everyday life gideon kossoff used the term transition design to describe the process of using design thinking and process to assist the transition to a sustainable society this early framing of transition design integrated holistic science including chaos complexity and systems theories and goethean science  with a tradition of non-authoritarian social and political philosophy that includes figures such as murray bookchin lewis mumford peter kropotkin martin buber and jane jacobs these figures can be called 'radical holists' since they use organicist holistic or ecological principles to underpin their advocacy of decentralized mutualistic and participatory social political and economic structures this 'radical holist' approach has been validated by holistic science which defines wholes in terms of dynamic and creative self-organisation mutualistic interdependencies and a reciprocal relationship between wholes and the parts of which they are constituted these principles are at the heart of an emerging ecological or holistic worldview that has been articulated by fritjof capra richard tarnas david abram and many others transition design can be thought of as a way of using this ecological worldview to address many contemporary problems
transition design in its initial development focused on everyday life since this is the context within which ecological social and economic problems arise and this is the arena within which such problems must be resolved it therefore drew on various critiques of everyday life such as those made by henri lefebvre guy debord and mikhail bakhtin
this framing of transition design proposes that in order to be sustainable everyday life will need to be organised according to holistic principles everyday life arises as people strive to satisfy their material and non-material needs it is more likely to be sustainable when communities control the satisfaction of their needs at all levels of scale — households neighbourhoods villages cities regions — 'the domains of everyday life' in traditional pre-industrial communities the domains emerged as people endeavoured to satisfy their needs embodying the social processes of such cultures the domains were to varying degrees self-organising participatory semi-autonomous and mutualistic and everyday life as a whole consisted of nested networks of households villages neighbourhoods and regions these characteristics are shared with living whole and ecological systems with the arrival of modernity and the industrial revolution control of need satisfaction was largely appropriated by centralized institutions when this happens the domains lose their role as loci for the satisfaction of the needs of their inhabitants and they no longer emerge as vital integrated semi-autonomous forms households neighbourhoods cities and regions are typically hollowed and fragmented their decline leads to many social ecological economic and political problems and to the unsustainability of everyday life there is therefore a direct relationship between sustainability community and place-based control of need satisfaction and holism in everyday life the transition to a sustainable society requires the reconstitution and reinvention of the domains of everyday life an additional domain that of the planet has emerged in modernity and its development could give everyday life a cosmopolitanism it lacked in pre-industrial societies
any place-based initiative that promotes holism in everyday life protecting and recovering control by communities of the process of need satisfaction will help the transition process it is the task of transition design to facilitate this at all levels of scale revitalising and improving the quality of everyday life through the development of nested networked integrated semi-autonomous and self-organizing households neighbourhoods cities and regions
aside this background the transformap initiative emerged with the objective to visualise socio-technical transition initiatives that occur in the domain of everyday life on a geographical map
transition design was first introduced in 2014 at carnegie mellon university's school of design where it informs projects curricula and programs at the undergraduate graduate and doctoral levels on march 7 2015 a transition design symposium was held at cmu's school of design this was structured around the position papers of twenty academics from a wide range of disciplines eg anthropology sociology architecture psychology human computer interaction philosophy design and design studies each position paper was a response to a 'provocation and briefing' document written by professor terry irwin dr cameron tonkinwise and dr gideon kossoff
