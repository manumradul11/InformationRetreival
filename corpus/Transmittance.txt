transmittance of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in transmitting radiant energy it is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is transmitted through a sample in contrast to the transmission coefficient which is the ratio of the transmitted to incident electric field
internal transmittance refers to energy loss by absorption whereas total transmittance is that due to absorption scattering reflection etc


hemispherical transmittance of a surface denoted t is defined as
where
spectral hemispherical transmittance in frequency and spectral hemispherical transmittance in wavelength of a surface denoted tν and tλ respectively are defined as
where
directional transmittance of a surface denoted tω is defined as
where
spectral directional transmittance in frequency and spectral directional transmittance in wavelength of a surface denoted tνω and tλω respectively are defined as
where
by definition transmittance is related to optical depth and to absorbance as
where
the beer–lambert law states that for n attenuating species in the material sample
or equivalently that
where
attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by
and number density and amount concentration by
where na is the avogadro constant
in case of uniform attenuation these relations become
or equivalently
cases of non-uniform attenuation occur in atmospheric science applications and radiation shielding theory for instance
