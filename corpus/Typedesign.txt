type design is the art and process of designing typeface


although the technology of printing text using movable type was invented in china and despite the esteem which calligraphy held in that civilization the vast number of chinese characters meant that few distinctive complete fonts were created in china in the early centuries of printing
gutenberg's innovation in the mid 15th century was not printing itself but casting type pieces with reusable molds from then until at least 400 years later type started with cutting punches which acted as the masters the material that was cut formed a prototype of the character from which type was cast by various means from an alloy usually containing lead type design accounted for the limitations of the printing process such as the splashing properties of ink or the wear on the type itself
in many countries though not the united states of america type design could be copyrighted typeface by typeface the usa offered and continues to offer design patents as an option for typeface design protection
beginning in the 1890s for the american type founders corporation and a few others using their technology each character was drawn in a very large size over a foot 30 cm high the outline was then traced by a benton pantograph-based engraving machine with a pointer at the hand-held vertex and a cutting tool at the opposite vertex down to a size usually less than a quarter-inch 6 mm the pantographic engraver was first used to cut punches and later to directly create matrices
with the coming of computers especially those on designers' desktops type design became a form of computer graphics employing specialized type design programs called font editors although the first digital fonts were pixel-based bitmap fonts by the mid-1990s scalable outline vector fonts became the norm hence most font editors are essentially specialized vector drawing programs
each glyph design can be drawn or traced by a stylus on a digitizing board or modified from a scanned drawing or composed entirely within the program itself each glyph is then in a digital form either in a bitmap pixel-based or vector scalable outline format although a given digitization of a typeface can be easily be modified by another type designer such a modified font is usually considered a derivative work and is covered by the copyright of the original font software
regardless of the method used to specify type design glyphs of the same character when designed for different sizes have slightly different shapes for improved legibility and to look more similar despite physical size differences artistic consistency
spacing is an important part of type design each glyph consists not only of the shape of the character but also the white space around it
designing type requires many accommodations for the quirks of human perception optical corrections required to make shapes look right in ways that diverge from what might seem mathematically right for example round shapes need to be slightly bigger than square ones to appear the same size overshoot and vertical lines need to be thicker than horizontal ones to appear the same thickness
type design is performed by a type designer it is a craft blending elements of art and science in the pre-digital era it was primarily learned through apprenticeship and professional training within the industry since the mid-1990s it has become the subject of dedicated degree programs at a handful of universities including the ma typeface design at the university of reading uk and the type media program at the kabk royal academy of art in the hague at the same time the transition to digital type and font editors which can be inexpensive or even open source and free has led to a great democratization of type design the craft is accessible to anyone with the interest to pursue it
type design along with architecture is one of the arts in which the concept of postmodernism best figures the modern period of type design was the mid-twentieth century during which sans-serif typefaces were supposed to be superior to all others due to their stark rationality suddenly in the 1960s professional typefaces started to appear that were not intended to be supremely readable just in a style that was fashionable one example is aldo novarese's 1971 typeface named stop which was used in various science fiction movies in the 1970scitation needed
