universal design often inclusive design refers to broad-spectrum ideas meant to produce buildings products and environments that are inherently accessible to older people people without disabilities and people with disabilities
the term universal design was coined by the architect ronald l mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone regardless of their age ability or status in life however it was the work of selwyn goldsmith author of designing for the disabled 1963 who really pioneered the concept of free access for disabled people his most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb - now a standard feature of the built environment
universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier-free concepts the broader accessibility movement and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations as life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries illnesses and birth defects there is a growing interest in universal design there are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent universal design is also being applied to the design of technology instruction services and other products and environments
curb cuts or sidewalk ramps essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all are a common example color-contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another there are also cabinets with pull-out shelves kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures and amidst many of the world's public transit systems low-floor buses that kneel bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap andor are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts


the center for universal design at north carolina state university expounds the following principles
each principle above is succinctly defined and contains a few brief guidelines that can be applied to design processes in any realm physical or digital
these principles are broader than those of accessible design and barrier-free design
in 1960 specifications for barrier free design were published it was a compendium of over 11 years of disability ergonomic research in 1961 the specifications became the first barrier free design standard called the american national standard a1171.1 was published it was the first standard to present the criteria for designing facilities and programs for the use of disabled individuals the research started in 1949 at the university of illinois urbana champaign campus and continues to this day the principal investigator is dr timothy nugent his name is listed in the front of the 1961 1971 1980 standard in 1949 dr nugent also started the national wheelchair basketball association this ansi a117.1 standard was adopted by the us federal government general services administration under 35 fr 4814 - 32070 39 fr 23214 - 62774 43 fr 16478 aba- 41978 44 fr 39393 7679 46 fr 39436 8381 in 1984 for ufas and then in 1990 for ada the archived research documents are at the international code council icc - ansi a117.1 division dr nugent made presentations around the globe in the late 50's and 60's presenting the concept of independent functional participation for individuals with disabilities through program options and architectural design
in november 2010 the international code council publication inclusive design guidelines new york city idg was released through the american institute of architects the idg is voluntary prescriptive technical guidance that helps designers produce multisensory enhanced environments that accommodate a wide range of physical and mental abilities for people of all ages this seminal universal design document is harmonized with a117.1 and a companion document to the new york city building code it consolidates in one source explicitly detailed design guidance that covers a substantial range of subject matter the idg is the result of collaboration between the new york city mayor's office for people with disabilities the international code council steven winter associates and a diverse team of contributors including prominent design firms advocates and people with disabilities
another comprehensive publication by the royal institute of british architects published three editions 1963 1967 1976 and 1997 of designing for the disabled by selwyn goldsmith uk the publications contain valuable empirical data and studies of individuals with disabilities both standards are excellent resources for the designer and builder
disability ergonomics should be taught to designers engineers non-profits executives to further the understanding of what makes an environment wholly tenable and functional for individuals with disabilities
in october 2003 representatives from china japan and south korea met in beijing and agreed to set up a committee to define common design standards for a wide range of products and services that are easy to understand and use their goal is to publish a standard in 2004 which covers among other areas standards on containers and wrappings of household goods based on a proposal from experts in japan and standardization of signs for public facilities a subject which was of particular interest to china as it prepared to host the 2008 summer olympics
the international organization for standardization the european committee for electrotechnical standardization and the international electrotechnical commission have developed
these standards are still under development
the term design for all dfa is used to describe a design philosophy targeting the use of products services and systems by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation design for all is design for human diversity social inclusion and equality eidd stockholm declaration 2004 according to the european commission it encourages manufacturers and service providers to produce new technologies for everyone technologies that are suitable for the elderly and people with disabilities as much as the teenage techno wizard the origin of design for all lies in the field of barrier free accessibility for people with disabilities and the broader notion of universal design
design for all has been highlighted in europe by the european commission in seeking a more user-friendly society in europe design for all is about ensuring that environments products services and interfaces work for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances
design for all has become a mainstream issue because of the aging of the population and its increasingly multi-ethnic composition it follows a market approach and can reach out to a broader market easy-to-use accessible affordable products and services improve the quality of life of all citizens design for all permits access to the built environment access to services and user-friendly products which are not just a quality factor but a necessity for many aging or disabled persons including design for all early in the design process is more cost-effective than making alterations after solutions are already in the market this is best achieved by identifying and involving users stakeholders in the decision-making processes that lead to drawing up the design brief and educating public and private sector decision-makers about the benefits to be gained from making coherent use of design for all in a wide range of socio-economic situations
the following examples of designs for all were presented in the book diseños para todosdesigns for all published in 2008 by optimastudio with the support of spain's ministry of education social affairs and sports imserso and ceapat
other useful items for those with mobility limitations
design for all criteria are aimed at ensuring that everyone can participate in the information society the european union refers to this under the terms einclusion and eaccessibility a three-way approach is proposed goods which can be accessed by nearly all potential users without modification or failing that products being easy to adapt according to different needs or using standardized interfaces that can be accessed simply by using assistive technology to this end manufacturers and service providers especially but not exclusively in the information and communication technologies ict produce new technologies products services and applications for everyone
in europe people have joined in networks to promote and develop design for all
barrier-free バリアフリー bariafurii? building modification consists of modifying buildings or facilities so that they can be used by people who are disabled or have physical impairments the term is used primarily in japan and non-english speaking countries eg german barrierefreiheit finnish esteettömän rakentamisen while in english-speaking countries terms such as accessibility and handicapped accessible dominate in regular everyday use an example of barrier-free design would be installing a ramp for wheelchairs alongside or in place of steps in the case of new buildings however the idea of barrier free modification has largely been superseded by the concept of universal design which seeks to design things from the outset to support easy access
freeing a building of barriers means
barrier free is also a term that applies to handicap accessibility in situations where legal codes such as the americans with disabilities act of 1990 guidelines don't make specifications
an example of a country that has sought to implement barrier-free accessibility in housing estates is singapore within five years all public housing estates in the country all of 7800 blocks of apartments have benefited from the program
