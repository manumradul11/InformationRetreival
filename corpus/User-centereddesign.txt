user-centered design ucd is a framework of processes not restricted to interfaces or technologies in which the needs wants and limitations of end users of a product service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process user-centered design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem solving process that not only requires designers to analyse and foresee how users are likely to use a product but also to test the validity of their assumptions with regard to user behavior in real world tests with actual users at each stage of the process from requirements concepts pre-production models mid production and post production creating a circle of proof back to and confirming or modifying the original requirements such testing is necessary as it is often very difficult for the designers of a product to understand intuitively what a first-time user of their design experiences and what each user's learning curve may look like
the chief difference from other product design philosophies is that user-centered design tries to optimize the product around how users can want or need to use the product rather than forcing the users to change their behavior to accommodate the product


for example the user-centered design process can help software designers to fulfill the goal of a product engineered for their users user requirements are considered right from the beginning and included into the whole product cycle these requirements are noted and refined through investigative methods including ethnographic study contextual inquiry prototype testing usability testing and other methods generative methods may also be used including card sorting affinity diagramming and participatory design sessions in addition user requirements can be inferred by careful analysis of usable products similar to the product being designed
all these approaches follow the iso standard 52075
the iso standard describes 6 key principles that will ensure a design is user centered
ucd answers questions about users and their tasks and goals then uses the findings to make decisions about development and design ucd of a web site for instance seeks to answer the following questions
as examples of ucd viewpoints the essential elements of ucd of a web site are considerations of visibility accessibility legibility and language
visibility helps the user construct a mental model of the document models help the user predict the effects of their actions while using the document important elements such as those that aid navigation should be emphatic users should be able to tell from a glance what they can and cannot do with the document
users should be able to find information quickly and easily throughout the document regardless of its length users should be offered various ways to find information such as navigational elements search functions table of contents clearly labeled sections page numbers color-coding etc navigational elements should be consistent with the genre of the document ‘chunking’ is a useful strategy that involves breaking information into small pieces that can be organized into some type meaningful order or hierarchy the ability to skim the document allows users to find their piece of information by scanning rather than reading bold and italic words are often used
text should be easy to read through analysis of the rhetorical situation the designer should be able to determine a useful font style ornamental fonts and text in all capital letters are hard to read but italics and bolding can be helpful when used correctly large or small body text is also hard to read screen size of 10-12 pixel sans serif and 12-16 pixel serif is recommended high figure-ground contrast between text and background increases legibility dark text against a light background is most legible
depending on the rhetorical situation certain types of language are needed short sentences are helpful as are well-written texts used in explanations and similar bulk-text situations unless the situation calls for it jargon or technical terms should not be used many writers will choose to use active voice verbs instead of noun strings or nominals and simple sentence structure
a user-centered design is focused around the rhetorical situation the rhetorical situation shapes the design of an information medium there are three elements to consider in a rhetorical situation audience purpose and context
the audience is the people who will be using the document the designer must consider their age geographical location ethnicity gender education etc
the purpose is what the document targets or what problem the document is trying to address
the context is the circumstances surrounding the situation the context often answers the question what situation has prompted the need for this document? context also includes any social or cultural issues that may surround the situation
there are a number of tools that are used in the analysis of user-centered design mainly personas scenarios and essential use cases
during the ucd process a persona representing the user may be created a persona is a user archetype used to help guide decisions about product features navigation interactions and even visual design in most cases personas are synthesized from a series of ethnographic interviews with real people then captured in 1-2 page descriptions that include behavior patterns goals skills attitudes and environment with a few fictional personal details to bring the persona to life
for each product or sometimes for each set of tools within a product there is a small set of personas one of whom is the primary focus for the design there are also what's called a secondary persona where the character is not the main target of the design but their needs should be met and problems solved if possible they exist to help account for further possible problems and difficulties that may occur even though the primary persona is satisfied with their solution there is also an anti-persona which is the character that the design is specifically not made for
personas are useful in the sense that they create a common shared understanding of the user group for which the design process is built around also they help to prioritize the design considerations by providing a context of what the user needs and what functions are simply nice to add and have they can also provide a human face and existence to a diversified and scattered user group and can also create some empathy and add emotions when referring to the users however since personas are a generalized perception of the primary stakeholder group from collected data the characteristics may be too broad and typical or too much of an average joe sometimes personas can have stereotypical properties also which may hurt the entire design process overall personas can be a useful tool to be used by designers to make informed design decisions around opposed to referring to a set of data or a wide range of individuals
a scenario created in the ucd process is a fictional story about the daily life of or a sequence of events with the primary stakeholder group as the main character typically a persona that was created earlier is used as the main character of this story the story should be specific of the events happening that relate to the problems of the primary stakeholder group and normally the main research questions the design process is built upon these may turn out to be a simple story about the daily life of an individual but small details from the events should imply details about the users and may include emotional or physical characteristics there can be the best-case scenario where everything works out best for the main character the worst-case scenario where the main character experiences everything going wrong around him or her and an average-case scenario which is the typical life of the individual where nothing really special or really depressing occurs and the day just moves on
scenarios create a social context in which the personas exist and also create an actual physical world instead of imagining a character with internal characteristics from gathered data and nothing else there is more action involved in the persona's existence a scenario is also more easily understood by people since it is in the form of a story and is easier to follow yet like the personas these scenarios are assumptions made by the researcher and designer and is also created from a set of organized data some even say such scenarios are unrealistic to real life occurrences also it is difficult to explain and inform low level tasks that occur like the thought process of the persona before acting
in short a use case describes the interaction between an individual and the rest of the world each use case describes an event that may occur for a short period of time in real life but may consist of intricate details and interactions between the actor and the world it is represented as a series of simple steps for the character to achieve his or her goal in the form of a cause-and effect scheme use cases are normally written in the form of a chart with two columns first column labelled actor second column labelled world and the actions performed by each side written in order in the respective columns the following is an example of a use case for performing a song on a guitar in front of an audience
the interaction between actor and the world is an act that can be seen in everyday life and we take them as granted and don't think too much about the small detail that needs to happen in order for an act like performing a piece of music to exist it is similar to the fact that when speaking our mother tongue we don't think too much about grammar and how to phrase words they just come out since we are so used to saying them the actions between an actor and the world notably the primary stakeholder user and the world in this case should be thought about in detail and hence use cases are created to understand how these tiny interactions occur
an essential use case is a special kind of use case also called an abstract use case essential use cases describe the essence of the problem and deals with the nature of the problem itself while writing use cases no assumptions about unrelated details should be made in additions the goals of the subject should be separated from the process and implementation to reach that particular goal below is an example of an essential use case with the same goal as the former example
use cases are useful because they help identify useful levels of design work they allow the designers to see the actual low level processes that are involved for a certain problem which makes the problem easier to handle since certain minor steps and details the user makes are exposed the designers' job should take into consideration of these small problems in order to arrive at a final solution that works another way to say this is that use cases breaks a complicated task into smaller bits where these bits are useful units each bit completes a small task which then builds up to the final bigger task like writing code on a computer it is easier to write the basic smaller parts and make them work first and then put them together to finish the larger more complicated code instead to tackling the entire code from the very beginning
the first solution is less risky because if something goes wrong with the code it is easier to look for the problem in the smaller bits since the segment with the problem will be the one that does not work while in the latter solution the programmer may have to look through the entire code to search for a single error which proves time consuming the same reasoning goes for writing use cases in ucd lastly use cases convey useful and important tasks where the designer can see which one are of higher importance than others some drawbacks of writing use cases include the fact that each action by the actor or the world consist of little detail and is simply a small action this may possibly lead to further imagination and different interpretation of action from different designers
also during the process it is really easy to oversimplify a task since a small task from a larger task may consist of even smaller tasks picking up a guitar may involve thinking of which guitar to pick up which pick to use and think about where the guitar is located first these tasks may then be divided into smaller tasks such as first thinking of what colour of guitar fits the place to perform the piece and other related details tasks may be split further down into even tinier tasks and it is up to the designer to determine what is a suitable place to stop splitting up the tasks tasks may not only be oversimplified they may also be omitted in whole thus the designer should be aware of all the detail and all the key steps that are involved in an event or action when writing use cases
the book the design of everyday things originally called the psychology of everyday things was first published in 1986 in this book donald a norman describes the psychology behind what he deems 'good' and 'bad' design through examples and offers principles of 'good' design he exalts the importance of design in our everyday lives and the consequences of errors caused by bad designs
in his book norman uses the term user-centered design to describe design based on the needs of the user leaving aside what he considers secondary issues like aesthetics user-centered design involves simplifying the structure of tasks making things visible getting the mapping right exploiting the powers of constraint and designing for error norman's overly reductivecitation needed approach in this text was readdressed by him later in his own publication emotional design
other books in a similar vein include designing pleasurable products by patrick w jordan in which the author suggests that different forms of pleasure should be included in a user-centered approach in addition to traditional definitions of usability
software applications or often suites of applications used in product lifecycle management typically including cad cam and cax processes can be typically characterized by the need for these solutions to serve the needs of a broad range of users with each user having a particular job role and skill level for example a cad digital mockup might be utilized by a novice analyst design engineer of moderate skills or a manufacturing planner of advanced skills
