user experience design uxd ued or xd is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability accessibility and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product user experience design encompasses traditional human窶田omputer interaction hci design and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users


the field of user experience design has roots in human factors and ergonomics a field that since the late 1940s has focused on the interaction between human users machines and the contextual environments to design systems that address the user's experience with the proliferation of workplace computers in the early 1990s user experience became an important concern for designers it was donald norman a user experience architect who coined and brought the term user experience to wider knowledge
i invented the term because i thought human interface and usability were too narrow i wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with the system including industrial design graphics the interface the physical interaction and the manual since then the term has spread widely so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning
the term also has a more recent connection to user-centered design human窶田omputer interaction and also incorporates elements from similar user-centered design fields
user experience design includes elements of interaction design information architecture user research and other disciplines and is concerned with all facets of the overall experience delivered to users following is a short analysis of its constituent parts
visual design also commonly known as graphic design communication design and visual communication represents the aesthetics or look-and-feel of the front end of any user interface graphic treatment of interface elements is often perceived as the visual design the purpose of visual design is to use visual elements like colors images and symbols to convey a message to its audience fundamentals of gestalt psychology and visual perception give a cognitive perspective on how to create effective visual communication
information architecture is the art and science of structuring and organizing the information in products and services supporting usability and findability
in the context of information architecture information is separate from both knowledge and data and lies nebulously between them it is information about objectscitation needed the objects can range from websites to software applications to images et al it is also concerned with metadata terms used to describe and represent content objects such as documents people process and organizations
structuring is reducing information to its basic building units and then relating them to each other organization involves grouping these units in a distinctive and meaningful manner labeling means using appropriate wording to support easy navigation and findability
findability is the most critical success factor for information architecturecitation needed if users are not able to find required information without browsing searching or asking then the findability of the information architecture fails navigation needs to be clearly conveyed to ease finding of the contents
there are many key factors to understanding interaction design and how it can enable a pleasurable end user experience it is well recognized clarification needed that building great user experience requires interaction design to play a pivotal role in helping define what works best for the users high demand for improved user experiences and strong focus on the end-users have made interaction designers critical in conceptualizing design that matches user expectations and standards of the latest ui patterns and components while working interaction designers take several things in consideration a few of them are
in the last few years the role of interaction designer has shifted from being just focused on specifying ui components and communicating them to the engineers to a situation now where designers have more freedom to design contextual interfaces which are based on helping meet the user needs therefore user experience design evolved into a multidisciplinary design branch that involves multiple technical aspects from motion graphics design and animation to programming
usability is the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use
usability is attached with all tools used by humans and is extended to both digital and non-digital devices thus it is a subset of user experience but not wholly contained the section of usability that intersects with user experience design is related to humans' ability to use a system or application good usability is essential to a positive user experience but does not alone guarantee it
accessibility of a system describes its ease of reach use and understanding in terms of user experience design it can also be related to the overall comprehensibility of the information and features it contributes to shorten the learning curve attached with the system accessibility in many contexts can be related to the ease of use for people with disabilities and comes under usability
human窶田omputer interaction is concerned with the design evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them
human窶田omputer interaction is the main contributor to user experience design because of its emphasis on human performance rather than mere usability it provides key research findings which inform the improvement of systems for the people human-computer interaction extends its study towards more integrated interactions such as tangible interactions which is generally not covered in the practice of user experience user experience cannot be manufactured or designed it has to be incorporated in the design understanding the user's emotional quotient plays a key role while designing a user experience the first step while designing the user experience is determining the reason a visitor will be visiting the website or use the application in question then the user experience can be designed accordingly
user experience design incorporates most or all of the above disciplines to positively impact the overall experience a person has with a particular interactive system and its provider user experience design most frequently defines a sequence of interactions between a user individual person and a system virtual or physical designed to meet or support user needs and goals primarily while also satisfying systems requirements and organizational objectives
typical outputs include
the steps involved in the process are
the ux designer needs to find out as much as they can about people process and products before the design phase the designers can do this by meeting with the clients or business stakeholders frequently to know what their requirements are designers also conduct interviews with users in their home or work spaces this kind of qualitative research helps designers create products and service that better serve user needs
after research the designer must make sense of the data they've collected typically this is done through modeling of the users and their environments user modeling or personas are composite archetypes based on behavior patterns uncovered during research personas provide designers a precise way of thinking and communicating about how groups of users behave how they think what they want to accomplish and why once created personas help the designer to understand the users' goals in specific contexts which is particularly useful during ideation and for validating design concepts other types of models include work flow models artifact models and physical models
when the designer has a firm grasp on the user's needs and goals they begin to sketch out the interaction framework also known as wireframes this stage defines the high-level structure of screen layouts as well as the product's flow behavior and organization there are many kinds of materials that can be involved in during this iterative phase from whiteboards to paper prototypes as the interaction framework establishes an overall structure for product behavior a parallel process focused on the visual and industrial designs the visual design framework defines the experience attributes visual language and the visual style
once a solid and stable framework is established wireframes are translated from sketched storyboards to full-resolution screens that depict the user interface at the pixel level at this point it's critical for the programming team to collaborate closely with the designer their input is necessary to creating a finished design that can and will be built while remaining true to the concept
usability testing is carried out through prototypes the target users are given various tasks to perform on the prototypes any issues or problems faced by the users are collected as field notes and these notes are used to make changes in the design and reiterate the testing phase usability testing is at its core a means to evaluate not create
ux designers' main goal is to solve the end-users' problems communicating the design is a critical part of the design process a designer may have the best design created but if they cannot communicate it well to their stakeholders and developers the design will fail the ux specification documents depend on the client or the organization involved in designing a product the four major deliverables are a title page an introduction to the feature wireframes and a version history depending on the type of project the specification documents can also include flow models cultural models personas user stories scenarios and any prior user research documenting design decisions in the form of annotated wireframes gives the developer the necessary information they may need to successfully code the project
depending on the company a user experience designer may need to be a jack of all trades it is not uncommon to see a user experience designer jump in at the beginning of the project lifecycle where the problem set and project definition is vague or after the project requirements document has been finalized and wireframes and functional annotations need to be created
the following details the responsibilities a user experience designer may have at each phase of a project
at the beginning when the project is more conceptual
while the project is underway
after the project has launched
as with the fields mentioned above user experience design is a highly multi-disciplinary field incorporating aspects of psychology anthropology architecture sociology computer science graphic design industrial design cognitive science and business depending on the purpose of the product ux may also involve content design disciplines such as communication design instructional design and game design the subject matter of the content may also warrant collaboration with a subject-matter expert on planning the ux from various backgrounds in business government or private groups more recently content strategy has come to represent a sub-field of ux
graphic designers focus on the aesthetic appeal of the design information is communicated to the users through text and images much importance is given to how the text and images look and attract the users graphic designers have to make stylistic choices about things like font color font type and image locations graphic designers focus on grabbing the user's attention with the way the design looks
the visual designer visd ensures that the visual representation of the design effectively communicates the data and hints and the expected behavior of the product at the same time the visual designer is responsible for conveying the brand ideals in the product and for creating a positive first impression this responsibility is shared with the industrial designer if the product involves hardware in essence a visual designer must aim for maximum usability combined with maximum desirability
interaction designers ixd are responsible for understanding and specifying how the product should behave this work overlaps with the work of both visual and industrial designers in a couple of important ways when designing physical products interaction designers must work with industrial designers early on to specify the requirements for physical inputs and to understand the behavioral impacts of the mechanisms behind them interaction designers cross paths with visual designers throughout the project visual designers guide the discussions of the brand and emotive aspects of the experience interaction designers communicate the priority of information flow and functionality in the interface
usability testing is the most common method used by designers to test their designs the basic idea behind conducting a usability test is to check whether the design of a product or brand works well with the target users while carrying out usability testing two things are being tested for whether the design of the product is successful and if it is not successful how can it be improved while designers are testing they are testing the design and not the user also every design is evolving the designers carry out usability testing at every stage of the design process
user experience design is integrated into software development and other forms of application development to inform feature requirements and interaction plans based upon the users' goals every new software introduced must keep pace with the rapid technological advancements the benefits associated with integration of these design principles include
