user interface design ui or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software such as computers home appliances mobile devices and other electronic devices with the focus on maximizing the user experience the goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible in terms of accomplishing user goals user-centered design
good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself graphic design and typography are utilized to support its usability influencing how the user performs certain interactions and improving the aesthetic appeal of the design design aesthetics may enhance or detract from the ability of users to use the functions of the interface the design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements eg mental model to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs
interface design is involved in a wide range of projects from computer systems to cars to commercial planes all of these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions yet also require some unique skills and knowledge as a result designers tend to specialize in certain types of projects and have skills centered on their expertise whether that be software design user research web design or industrial design


user interface design requires a good understanding of user needs there are several phases and processes in the user interface design some of which are more demanded upon than others depending on the project note for the remainder of this section the word system is used to denote any project whether it is a website application or device
the dynamic characteristics of a system are described in terms of the dialogue requirements contained in seven principles of part 10 of the ergonomics standard the iso 9241 this standard establishes a framework of ergonomic principles for the dialogue techniques with high-level definitions and illustrative applications and examples of the principles the principles of the dialogue represent the dynamic aspects of the interface and can be mostly regarded as the feel of the interface the seven dialogue principles are
the concept of usability is defined of the iso 9241 standard by effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction of the user part 11 gives the following definition of usability
effectiveness efficiency and satisfaction can be seen as quality factors of usability to evaluate these factors they need to be decomposed into sub-factors and finally into usability measures
the information presentation is described in part 12 of the iso 9241 standard for the organization of information arrangement alignment grouping labels location for the display of graphical objects and for the coding of information abbreviation color size shape visual cues by seven attributes the attributes of presented information represent the static aspects of the interface and can be generally regarded as the look of the interface the attributes are detailed in the recommendations given in the standard each of the recommendations supports one or more of the seven attributes the seven presentation attributes are
the user guidance in part 13 of the iso 9241 standard describes that the user guidance information should be readily distinguishable from other displayed information and should be specific for the current context of use user guidance can be given by the following five means
user interface design has been a topic of considerable research including on its aesthetics standards have been developed as far back as the 1980s for defining the usability of software products one of the structural bases has become the ifip user interface reference model the model proposes four dimensions to structure the user interface
this model has greatly influenced the development of the international standard iso 9241 describing the interface design requirements for usability the desire to understand application-specific ui issues early in software development even as an application was being developed led to research on gui rapid prototyping tools that might offer convincing simulations of how an actual application might behave in production use some of this research has shown that a wide variety of programming tasks for gui-based software can in fact be specified through means other than writing program code
research in recent years is strongly motivated by the increasing variety of devices that can by virtue of moore's law host very complex interfaces
research has also been conducted on generating user interfaces automatically to match a user's level of ability for different levels of interaction
at the moment in addition to traditional prototypes the literature proposes new solutions such as an experimental mixed prototype based on a configurable physical prototype that allow to achieve a complete sense of touch thanks to the physical mock-up and a realistic visual experience thanks to the superimposition of the virtual interface on the physical prototype with augmented reality techniques
