ventilation is the intentional introduction of outside air into a space ventilation is mainly used to control indoor air quality by diluting and displacing indoor pollutants it can also be used for purposes of thermal comfort or dehumidification when the introduction of outside air will help to achieve desired indoor psychrometric conditions
the intentional introduction of outside air can be categorized as either mechanical ventilation or natural ventilation mechanical ventilation uses fans to drive the flow of outside air into a building this may be accomplished by pressurization in the case of positively pressurized buildings or by depressurization in the case of exhaust ventilation systems many mechanically ventilated buildings use a combination of both with the ventilation being integrated into the hvac system natural ventilation is the intentional passive flow of outside air into a building through planned openings such as louvers doors and windows natural ventilation does not require mechanical systems to move outside air it relies entirely on passive physical phenomena such as wind pressure or the stack effect mixed mode ventilation systems use both mechanical and natural processes the mechanical and natural components may be used in conjunction with each other or separately at different times of day or season of the year since the natural component can be affected by unpredictable environmental conditions it may not always provide an appropriate amount of ventilation in this case mechanical systems may be used to supplement or to regulate the naturally driven flow
outdoor air can also enter a building by infiltration - the uncontrolled flow of air from outdoors to indoors through leaks unplanned openings in a building envelope in buildings that make no intentional design for mechanical or natural ventilation circumstantial infiltration has been referred to as adventitious ventilation in exhaust ventilated buildings the intended flow of outside air may enter through planned inlets but it will also enter through unplanned leaks in the building envelope generally all outside air that crosses the building envelope through leaks is referred to as infiltration whether it is driven by mechanical systems or natural mechanisms like wind
in many instances ventilation for indoor air quality is simultaneously beneficial for the control of thermal comfort at these times it can be useful to increase the rate of ventilation beyond the minimum required for indoor air quality two examples include air-side economizer strategies and ventilation pre-cooling in other instances ventilation for indoor air quality contributes to the need for - and energy use by - mechanical heating and cooling equipment it hot and humid climates dehumidification of ventilation air can be a particularly energy intensive process
in many scenarios heat recovery ventilation can reduce energy use for heating and cooling by facilitating sensible heat exchange between exhaust air and incoming ventilation air energy recovery ventilation transfers moisture in addition to sensible heat however heat recovery can increase the fan power required for ventilation and may increase energy use for heating and cooling for periods when ventilation would be beneficial for the control of indoor thermal comfort
the design of buildings that promote occupant health and well being requires clear understanding of the ways that ventilation airflow interacts with dilutes displaces or introduces pollutants within the occupied space although ventilation is an integral component to maintaining good indoor air quality it may not be satisfactory alone in scenarios where outdoor pollution would deteriorate indoor air quality other treatment devices such as filtration may also be necessary in kitchen ventilation systems or for laboratory fume hoods the design of effective effluent capture can be more important than the bulk amount of ventilation in a space more generally the way that an air distribution system causes ventilation to flow into and out of a space impacts the ability for a particular ventilation rate to remove internally generated pollutants the ability for a system to remove pollution is described as its ventilation effectiveness however the overall impacts of ventilation on indoor air quality can depend on more complex factors such as the sources of pollution and the ways that activities and airflow interact to affect occupant exposure
ventilation should not be confused with air motion induced by ceiling fans or other devices air motion influences thermal comfort it can decrease thermal stratification and it may cause pollutant dilution by way of mixing but it does not introduce outside air and therefore does not classify as ventilation
ventilation should be considered for its relationship to venting for appliances and combustion equipment such as water heaters furnaces boilers and wood stoves most importantly the design of building ventilation must be careful to avoid the backdraft of combustion products from naturally vented appliances into the occupied space this issue is of greater importance in new buildings with more air tight envelopes to avoid the hazard many modern combustion appliances utilize direct venting which draws combustion air directly from outdoors instead of from the indoor environment


the ventilation rate for cii buildings is normally expressed by the volumetric flowrate of outside air being introduced to the building the typical units used are cubic feet per minute cfm or liters per second ls the ventilation rate can also be expressed on a per person or per unit floor area basis such as cfmp or cfmft² or as air changes per hour ach
for residential buildings which mostly rely on infiltration for meeting their ventilation needs a common ventilation rate measure is the air change rate or air changes per hour the hourly ventilation rate divided by the volume of the space i or ach units of 1h during the winter ach may range from 0.50 to 0.41 in a tightly insulated house to 1.11 to 1.47 in a loosely insulated house
ashrae now recommends ventilation rates dependent upon floor area as a revision to the 62-2001 standard in which the minimum ach was 0.35 but no less than 15 cfmperson 7.1 lsperson as of 2003 the standard has been changed to 3 cfm100 sq ft 15 ls100 sq m plus 7.5 cfmperson 3.5 lsperson 
ventilation rate procedure is rate based on standard and prescribes the rate at which ventilation air must be delivered to a space and various means to condition that air air quality is assessed through co2 measurement and ventilation rates are mathematically derived using constants indoor air quality procedure uses one or more guidelines for the specification of acceptable concentrations of certain contaminants in indoor air but does not prescribe ventilation rates or air treatment methods this addresses both quantitative and subjective evaluations and is based on the ventilation rate procedure it also accounts for potential contaminants that may have no measured limits or for which no limits are not set such as formaldehyde offgassing from carpet and furniture
in certain applications such as submarines pressurized aircraft and spacecraft ventilation air is also needed to provide oxygen and to dilute carbon dioxide for survival batteries in submarines also discharge hydrogen gas which must also be ventilated for health and safety in any pressurized regulated environment ventilation is necessary to control any fires that may occur as the flames may be deprived of oxygen
ansiashrae standard 62-89 speculated that comfort odor criteria are likely to be satisfied if the ventilation rate is set so that 1000 ppm co2 is not exceeded while osha has set a limit of 5000 ppm over 8 hours
ventilation guidelines are based upon the minimum ventilation rate required to maintain acceptable levels of bioeffluents carbon dioxide is used as a reference point as it is the gas of highest emission at a relatively constant value of 0.005 ls the mass balance equation is
q = gci − ca
ventilating a space with fresh air aims to avoid bad air the study of what constitutes bad air dates back to the 1600s when the scientist mayow studied asphyxia of animals in confined bottles the poisonous component of air was later identified as carbon dioxide co2 by lavoisier in the very late 1700s starting a debate as to the nature of bad air which humans perceive to be stuffy or unpleasant early hypotheses included excess concentrations of co2 and oxygen depletion however by the late 1800s scientists thought biological contamination not oxygen or co2 as the primary component of unacceptable indoor air however it was noted as early as 1872 that co2 concentration closely correlates to perceived air quality
the first estimate of minimum ventilation rates was developed by tredgold in 1836 this was followed by subsequent studies on the topic by billings  in 1886 and flugge in 1905 the recommendations of billings and flugge were incorporated into numerous building codes from 1900-1920s and published as an industry standard by ashve the predecessor to ashrae in 1914
study continued into the varied effects of thermal comfort oxygen carbon dioxide and biological contaminants research was conducted with humans subjects controlled test chambers two studies published between 1909 and 1911 showed that carbon dioxide was not the offending component subjects remained satisfied in chambers with high levels of co2 so long as the chamber remained cool subsequently it has been determined that co2 is in fact harmful at concentrations over 50000ppm 
ashve began a robust research effort in 1919 by 1935 ashve funded research conducted by lemberg brandt and morse - again using human subjects in test chambers - suggested the primary component of bad air was odor perceived by the human olfactory nerves human response to odor was found to be logarithmic to contaminant concentrations and related to temperature at lower more comfortable temperatures lower ventilation rates were satisfactory a 1936 human test chamber study by yaglou riley and coggins culminated much of this effort considering odor room volume occupant age cooling equipment effects and recirculated air implications which provided guidance for ventilation rates the yaglou research has been validated and adopted into industry standards beginning with the asa code in 1946 from this research base ashrae having replaced ashve developed space by space recommendations and published them as ashrae standard 62-1975 ventilation for acceptable indoor air quality
as more architecture incorporated mechanical ventilation the cost of outdoor air ventilation came under some scrutiny in cold warm humid or dusty climates it is preferable to minimize ventilation with outdoor air to conserve energy cost or filtration this critique eg tiller  led ashrae to reduce outdoor ventilation rates in 1981 particularly in non-smoking areas however subsequent research by fanger w cain and janssen validated the yaglou model
ashrae continues to publish space-by-space ventilation rate recommendations which are decided by a consensus committee of industry experts the modern descendants of ashrae standard 62-1975 are ashrae standard 62.1 for non-residential spaces and ashrae 62.2 for residences
in 2004 the calculation method was revised to include both an occupant-based contamination component and an area–based contamination component these two components are additive to arrive at an overall ventilation rate the change was made to recognize that densely populated areas were sometimes overventilated leading to higher energy and cost using a per-person methodology
occupant based ventilation rates ansiashrae standard 62.1-2004
area-based ventilation rates ansiashrae standard 62.1-2004
the addition of occupant- and area-based ventilation rates found in the tables above often results in significantly reduced rates compared to the former standard this is compensated in other sections of the standard which require that this minimum amount of air is actually delivered to the breathing zone of the individual occupant at all times the total outdoor air intake of the ventilation system in multiple-zone variable air volume vav systems might therefore be similar to the airflow required by the 1989 standard from 1999 to 2010 there was considerable development of the application protocol for ventilation rates these advancements address occupant- and process-based ventilation rates room ventilation effectivness and system ventilation effectivness 
natural ventilation harnessing naturally available forces to supply and remove air in an enclosed space there are three types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings wind driven ventilation pressure-driven flows and stack ventilation the pressures generated by 'the stack effect' rely upon the buoyancy of heated or rising air wind driven ventilation relies upon the force of the prevailing wind to pull and push air through the enclosed space as well as through breaches in the building’s envelope see infiltration hvac
almost all historic buildings were ventilated naturally the technique was generally abandoned in larger us buildings during the late 20th century as the use of air conditioning became more widespread however with the advent of advanced building energy modeling bem software improved building automation systems bas leadership in energy and environmental design leed design requirements and improved window manufacturing techniques natural ventilation has made a resurgence in commercial buildings both globally and throughout the us
the benefits of natural ventilation include
demand-controlled ventilation dcv also known as demand control ventilation makes it possible to maintain air quality while conserving energy ashrae has determined that it is consistent with the ventilation rate procedure that demand control be permitted for use to reduce the total outdoor air supply during periods of less occupancy in a dcv system co2 sensors control the amount of ventilation during peak occupancy co2 levels rise and the system adjusts to deliver the same amount of outdoor air as would be used by the ventilation-rate procedure however when spaces are less occupied co2 levels reduce and the system reduces ventilation to conserves energy dcv is a well-established practice and is required in high occupancy spaces by building energy standards such as ashrae 90.1
personalized ventilation is an air distribution strategy that allows individuals to control the amount of ventilation received the approach deliver fresh air more directly to the breathing zone and aims to improve air quality of inhaled air personalized ventilation provides a much higher ventilation effectiveness than conventional mixing ventilation systems by displacing pollution from the breathing zone far less air volume beyond improved air quality benefits the strategy can also improve occupant's thermal comfort perceived air quality and overall satisfaction with the indoor environment individual's preferences for temperature and air movement are not equal and so traditional approaches to homogeneous environmental control have failed to achieve high occupant satisfaction techniques such as personalized ventilation facilitate control of a more diverse thermal environment that can improve thermal satisfaction for most occupants
local exhaust ventilation addresses the issue of avoiding the contamination of indoor air by specific high-emission sources by capturing airborne contaminants before they are spread into the environment this can include water vapor control lavatory bioeffluent control solvent vapors from industrial processes and dust from wood- and metal-working machinery air can be exhausted through pressurized hoods or through the use of fans and pressurizing a specific area a local exhaust system is composed of 5 basic parts
in the uk the use of lev systems have regulations set out by the health and safety executive hse which are referred to as the control of substances hazardous to health coshh under coshh legislation is set out to protect users of lev systems by ensuring that all equipment is tested at least every fourteen months to ensure the lev systems are performing adequately all parts of the system must be visually inspected and thoroughly tested and where any parts are found to be defective the inspector must issue a red label to identify the defective part and the issue
the owner of the lev system must then have the defective parts repaired or replaced before the system can be used
combustion eg fireplace gas heater candle oil lamp etc consumes oxygen while producing carbon dioxide and other unhealthy gases and smoke requiring ventilation air an open chimney promotes infiltration ie natural ventilation because of the negative pressure change induced by the buoyant warmer air leaving through the chimney the warm air is typically replaced by heavier cold air
ventilation in a structure is also needed for removing water vapor produced by respiration burning and cooking and for removing odors if water vapor is permitted to accumulate it may damage the structure insulation or finishescitation needed when operating an air conditioner usually removes excess moisture from the air a dehumidifier may also be appropriate for removing airborne moisture
ashrae standard 62 states that air removed from an area with environmental tobacco smoke shall not be recirculated into ets-free air a space with ets requires more ventilation to achieve similar perceived air quality to that of a non-smoking environment
the amount of ventilation in an ets area is equal to the amount of ets-free area plus the amount v where
v = dsd × va × a60e
the development of forced ventilation was spurred by the common belief in the late 18th and early 19th century in the miasma theory of disease where stagnant 'airs' were thought to spread illness an early method of ventilation was the use of a ventilating fire near an air vent which would forcibly cause the air in the building to circulate english engineer john theophilus desaguliers provided an early example of this when he installed ventilating fires in the air tubes on the roof of the house of commons starting with the covent garden theatre gas burning chandeliers on the ceiling were often specially designed to perform a ventilating role
a more sophisticated system involving the use of mechanical equipment to circulate the air was developed in the mid 19th century a basic system of bellows was put in place to ventilate newgate prison and outlying buildings by the engineer stephen hales in the mid-18th century the problem with these early devices was that they required constant human labour to operate david boswell reid was called to testify before a parliamentary committee on proposed architectural designs for the new house of commons after the old one burned down in a fire in 1834 in january 1840 reid was appointed by the committee for the house of lords dealing with the construction of the replacement for the houses of parliament the post was in the capacity of ventilation engineer in effect and with its creation there began a long series of quarrels between reid and charles barry the architect
he advocated the installation of a very advanced ventilation system in the new house his design had air being drawn into an underground chamber where it would undergo either heating or cooling it would then ascend into the chamber through thousands of small holes drilled into the floor and would be extracted through the ceiling by a special ventilation fire within a great stack
reid's reputation was made by his work in westminster he was commissioned for an air quality survey in 1837 by the leeds and selby railway in their tunnel the steam vessels built for the niger expedition of 1841 were fitted with ventilation systems based on reid's westminster model air was dried filtered and passed over charcoal reid's ventilation method was also applied more fully to st george's hall liverpool where the architect harvey lonsdale elmes requested that reid should be involved in ventilation design reid considered this the only building in which his system was completely carried out
with the advent of practical steam power fans could finally be used for ventilation reid installed four steam powered fans in the ceiling of st george's hospital in liverpool so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling reid's pioneering work provides the basis for ventilation systems to this day he was remembered as dr reid the ventilator in the twenty-first century in discussions of energy efficiency by lord wade of chorlton
