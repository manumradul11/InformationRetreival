video game design is the process of designing the content and rules of a video game in the pre-production stage and designing the gameplay environment storyline and characters in the production stage the designer of a game is very much like the director of a film the designer is the visionary of the game and controls the artistic and technical elements of the game in fulfillment of their vision video game design requires artistic and technical competence as well as writing skills within the video game industry video game design is usually just referred to as game design which is a more general term elsewhere
video game designers have also sometimes comprised the entire art team this is the case of such noted designers as sid meier john romero chris sawyer and will wright a notable exception to this policy was coleco which from its very start separated the function of design and programming
as games became more complex and computers and consoles became more powerful the job of the game designer became separate from the lead programmer soon game complexity demanded team members focused on game design many early veterans chose the game design path eschewing programming and delegating those tasks to others
with very complex games such as mmorpgs or a big budget action or sports title designers may number in the dozens in these cases there are generally one or two principal designers and many junior designers who specify subsets or subsystems of the game in larger companies like electronic arts each aspect of the game control level design may have a separate producer lead designer and several general designers they may also come up with a plot for the game


video game design starts with an idea often a modification on an existing concept the game idea may fall within one or several genres designers often experiment with mixing genres the game designer usually produces an initial game proposal document containing the concept gameplay feature list setting and story target audience requirements and schedule staff and budget estimates
many decisions are made during the course of a game's development about the game's design it is the responsibility of the designer to decide which elements will be implemented based on for example consistency with the game's vision budget or hardware limitations design changes may have a significant positive or negative impact on required resources
the designer may use scripting languages to implement and preview design ideas without necessarily modifying the game's codebase
a game designer often plays video games and demos to follow the game market development
it is common for the game designer's name to misleadingly be given an undue amount of association to the game neglecting the rest of the development team
funding game publishers must be taken into account who may have specific expectations from a game as most video games are market-driven — developed to sell for profit however if financial issues do not influence designer's decisions the game becomes design- or designer-driven few games are designed this way because of lack of funding alternatively a game may be technology-driven such as quake 1996 to show off a particular hardware achievement or to market the game engine finally a game may be art-driven such as myst 1993 mainly to show off impressive visuals designed by artists
in the study of games 1971 brian sutton-smith writes
 a game designer is a particular kind of designer much like a graphic designer industrial designer or architect a game designer is not necessarily a programmer visual designer or project manager although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game a game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team a game designer might create card games social games video games or any other kind of game the focus of a game designer is designing game play conceiving and designing rules and structures that result in an experience for players
thus game design as a discipline requires a focus on games in and of themselves rather than placing games in the service of another field such as sociology literary criticism or computer science our aim is to study games within their own disciplinary space because game design is an emerging discipline we often borrow from other areas of knowledge — from mathematics and cognitive science from semiotics and cultural studies we may not borrow in the most orthodox manner but we do so in the service of helping to establish a field of game design proper
a game designer is a person who designs gameplay conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a game many designers start their career in testing departments other roles in game development or in classroom conditions where mistakes by others can be seen first-hand
in 2010 a game designer with more than six years of experience earned an average of us$65000 gbp £44761.22 $54000 gbp £37186.24 with three to six years of experience and $44000 gbp £30299.90 with less than 3 years of experience lead designers earned $75000 gbp £51647.56 with three to six years of experience and $95000gbp £65420.24 with more than six years of experience in 2013 a game designer with less than 3 years of experience earned on average $55000 gbp £37874.88 a game designer with more than 6 years of experience made on average $105000 gbp £72306.58 the average salary of these designers varies depending on their region as of 2015 the salary of experienced workers has shifted to approximately $87000 usd gbp £59911.17 
world design is the creation of a backstory setting and theme for the game often done by a lead designer
system design is the creation of game rules and underlying mathematical patterns
content design is the creation of characters items puzzles and missions
a secondary definition of content design is the creation of any aspect of the game that that is not required for the game to function properly and meet the minimum viable product standard in essence content is the complexity added to a minimum viable product to increase its value an example of this is the item list from final fantasy none of the items are necessary for the game to function but they add value and complexity to the game as a whole
game writing involves writing dialogue text and story
writing in games also includes the elements in which the literature is presented voice acting text and music are all elements of game writing
level design is the construction of world levels and its features
level design makes use of many different fields to create a game world lighting space framing color and contrast are used to draw a player's attention a designer can then use these elements to guide or direct the player in a specific direction through the game world or mislead them
user interface designer constructs the user interactions and feedback interface like menus or heads-up displays
the user interface also incorporates game mechanics design deciding how much information to give the player and in what way allows the designer to inform the player about the world or perhaps leave them uninformed these choices have a profound effect on the mood of the game as it directly affects the player in clearly understood and noticeable ways
audio design involves the process of creating or incorporating all of the sounds that are in the game like sound effects or voice actingcitation needed
numerous games have narrative elements which give a context to an event in a game making the activity of playing it less abstract and enhance its entertainment value although narrative elements are not always clearly present or present at all the original version of tetris is an example of a game apparently without narrative it should be noted that somewho? narratologists claim that all games have a narrative element some go further and claim that games are essentially a form of narrative narrative in practice can be the starting point for the development of a game or can be added to a design that started as a set of game mechanicscitation needed
gameplay is the interactive aspects of video game design gameplay involves player interaction with the game usually for the purpose of entertainment education or training
the design process varies from designer to designer and companies have different formal procedures and philosophies
the typical textbook approach is to start with a concept or a previously completed game and from there create a game design documentcitation needed this document is intended to map out the complete game design and acts as a central resource for the development team this document should ideally be updated as the game evolves throughout the production process
designers are frequently expected to adapt to multiple roles of widely varying nature for example concept prototyping can be assisted with the use of pre-existing engines and tools like game maker unity or construct level designs might be done first on paper and again for the game engine using a 3d modelling tool scripting languages are used for many elements—ai cutscenes gui environmental processes and many other behaviours and effects—that designers would want to tune without a programmer's assistance setting story and character concepts require a research and writing process designers may oversee focus testing write up art and audio asset lists and write game documentation in addition to the skillset designers are ideally clear communicators with attention to detail and ability to delegate responsibilities appropriatelycitation needed
design approvalclarification needed in the commercial setting is a continuous process from the earliest stages until the game ships
when a new project is being discussed either internally or as a result of dialogue with potential publishers the designer may be asked to write a sell-sheet of short concepts followed by a one or two-page pitch of specific features audience platform and other details designers will first meet with leads in other departments to establish agreement on the feasibility of the game given the available time scope and budget if the pitch is approved early milestones focus on the creation of a fleshed-out design document some developers advocate a prototyping phase before the design document is written to experiment with new ideas before they become part of the designoriginal research?
as production progresses designers are asked to make frequent decisions about elements missing from the design the consequences of these decisions are hard to predict and often can only be determined after creating the full implementation these are referred to as the unknowns of the design and the faster they are uncovered the less risk the team faces later in the production process outside factors such as budget cuts or changes in milestone expectations also result in cuts to the design and while overly large cuts can take the heart out of a project cuts can also result in a streamlined design with only the essential features polished welloriginal research?
towards the end of production designers take the brunt of responsibility for ensuring that the gameplay remains at a uniform standard throughout the game even in very long games this task is made more difficult under crunch conditions as the entire team may begin to lose sight of the core gameplay once pressured to hit a date for a finished and bug-free gameoriginal research?
