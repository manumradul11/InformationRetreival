a window is an opening in a wall door roof or vehicle that allows the passage of light and if not closed or sealed air and sound
modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material windows are held in place by frames many glazed windows may be opened to allow ventilation or closed to exclude inclement weather windows often have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut
types include the eyebrow window fixed windows single-hung and double-hung sash windows horizontal sliding sash windows casement windows awning windows hopper windows tilt and slide windows often door-sized tilt and turn windows transom windows sidelight windows jalousie or louvered windows clerestory windows skylights roof windows roof lanterns bay windows oriel windows thermal or diocletian windows picture windows emergency exit windows stained glass windows french windows and double- and triple paned windows
the romans were the first known to use glass for windows a technology likely first produced in roman egypt in alexandria ca 100 ad paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient china korea and japan in england glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were perfected


the english language-word window originates from the old norse 'vindauga' from 'vindr – wind' and 'auga – eye' ie wind eye in norwegian nynorsk and icelandic the old norse form has survived to this day in icelandic only as a less used synonym to gluggi in swedish the word vindöga remains as a term for a hole through the roof of a hut and in the danish language 'vindue' and norwegian bokmål 'vindu' the direct link to 'eye' is lost just like for 'window' the danish but not the bokmål word is pronounced fairly similarly to window
window is first recorded in the early 13th century and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof window replaced the old english eagþyrl which literally means 'eye-hole' and 'eagduru' 'eye-door' many germanic languages however adopted the latin word 'fenestra' to describe a window with glass such as standard swedish 'fönster' or german 'fenster' the use of window in english is probably because of the scandinavian influence on the english language by means of loanwords during the viking age in english the word fenester was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century fenestration is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a façade as well as defenestration meaning to throw something out of a window
the earliest windows were just holes in a wall later windows were covered with animal hide cloth or wood shutters that could be opened and closed came next over time windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light using multiple small pieces of translucent material such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn thin slices of marble or pieces of glass set in frameworks of wood iron or lead in the far east paper was used to fill windows the romans were the first known to use glass for windows a technology likely first produced in roman egypt namely in alexandria ca 100 ad cast glass windows albeit with poor optical properties began to appear but these were small thick productions little more than blown glass jars cylindrical shapes flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout it would be over a millennium before a window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly as we think of it now
over the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass cylinder and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material this gave rise to tall narrow windows usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion mullioned glass windows were the windows of choice among european well-to-do whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient china korea and japan in england glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century noted science historian author and television show hostproducer james burke attributes the rapid deforestation of great britain in the late 1500s to the uptick in production of glazed windows as well as iron cannon production 1st cast in 1547 he writes further this gave rise to coal for fuel which spurred iron production requiring more coal and more iron then steam engine pumps canals and more iron all because windows became a middle class commodity in the latter days of the little ice age one large factor among several leading to the deforesting english woodlands and the switch over to a coal economy
modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were perfected modern windows are usually filled with glass although a few are transparent plastic
the term eyebrow window is used in two ways a curved top window in a wall or in an eyebrow dormer and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the james-lorah house in pennsylvania
a window that cannot be opened whose function is limited to allowing light to enter unlike an unfixed window which can open and close clerestory windows are often fixed transom windows may be fixed or operable this type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible windows without the use of trickle vents or overglass vents
one sash is movable usually the bottom one and the other fixed this is the earlier form of sliding sash window and is also cheaper
a sash window is the traditional style of window in the united kingdom and many other places that were formerly colonized by the uk with two parts sashes that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame the two parts are not necessarily the same size currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes but traditionally counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used these were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or later purpose-made chain three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance channel or block-and-tackle balance and a spiral or tube balance
double-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with shutters sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side while the rope on the other side is detached—so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning
has two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame in the uk these are sometimes called yorkshire sash windows presumably because of their traditional use in that county
a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung top-hung also called awning window see below or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash in the usa these are usually opened using a crank but in parts of europe they tend to use projection friction stays and espagnolette locking formerly plain hinges were used with a casement stay handing applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing a casement window may be left-handed right-handed or double the casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the uk and many other parts of europe
an awning window is a casement window that is hung horizontally hinged on top so that it swings outward like an awning in addition to being used independently they can be stacked several in one opening or combined with fixed glass they are particularly useful for ventilation
a hopper window is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically typically to the inside mostly used for schools
a window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened the hinges may be mounted top and bottom vertically pivoted or at each jamb horizontally pivoted the window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and once released fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in in the uk where this type of window is most common they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing
a window more usually a door-sized window where the sash tilts inwards at the top and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane
a tilt and turn window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side this is the most common type of window in germany its country of origin it is also widespread in many other european countries in europe it is usual for these to be of the turn first type ie when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode with the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode most usually in the uk the windows will be tilt first ie bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building
a window above a door in an exterior door the transom window is often fixed in an interior door it can open either by hinges at top or bottom or rotate on hinges it provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling a fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight especially in the british isles
windows beside a door or window are called side- wing- and margen-lights and flanking windows
also known as a louvered window the jalousie window consists of parallel slats of glass or acrylic that open and close like a venetian blind usually using a crank or a lever they are used extensively in tropical architecture a jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window
a window set in a roof structure or high in a wall used for daylighting
a flat or slope window used for daylighting built into a roof structure that is out of reach
a sloped window used for daylighting built into a roof structure it is one of the few windows that could be used as an exit larger roof windows meet building codes for emergency evacuation
a roof lantern is a multi-paned glass structure resembling a small building built on a roof for day or moon light sometimes includes an additional clerestory may also be called a cupola
a multi-panel window with at least three panels set at different angles to create a protrusion from the wall line
this form of bay window most often appears in tudor-style houses and monasteries it projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground originally a form of porch they are often supported by brackets or corbels
thermal or diocletian windows are large semicircular windows or niches which are usually divided into three lights window compartments by two mullions the central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it
a picture window is a large fixed window in a wall typically without glazing bars or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars near the edge of the window picture windows provide an unimpeded view as if framing a picture
a window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead glazing bars or muntins arranged in a decorative glazing pattern often dictated by the building's architectural style due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass the multi-lit or lattice window was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century and is still used in traditional architecture
a window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency such as a fire in many countries exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many building codes specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers vehicles such as buses and aircraft frequently have emergency exit windows as well
a window composed of pieces of colored glass transparent translucent or opaque frequently portraying persons or scenes typically the glass in these windows is separated by lead glazing bars stained glass windows were popular in victorian houses and some wrightian houses and are especially common in churches
a french window when hinged french door is a large door-sized lattice light typically set in pairs or multiples thereof known as porte-fenêtre in france and portafinestra in italy they often overlook a terrace and are commonly used in modern houses 
double-paned windows have two parallel panes slabs of glass with a separation of typically about 1 cm this space is permanently sealed and filled at the time of manufacture with dry air or other dry nonreactive gas such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation and usually in acoustic insulation as well and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential they are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates triple-paned windows have been commercially manufactured and marketed with claims of additional benefit but have not become common
en 12519 is the european norm that describes windows terms officially used in eu member states the main terms are
the united states nfrc window label lists the following terms
the european harmonised standard hen 14351-1 which deals with doors and windows defines 23 characteristics divided into essential and non essential two other preliminary european norms that are under development deal with internal pedestrian doors pren 14351-2 smoke and fire resisting doors and openable windows pren 16034
windows can be a significant source of heat transfer therefore insulated glazing units consist of two or more panes to reduce the transfer of heat
these are the pieces of framing that separate a larger window into smaller panes in older windows large panes of glass were quite expensive so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space in modern windows light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window making the window itself a source of diffuse light instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room by increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room
frames and sashes can be made of the following materials
* pvc and fiberglass frames perform well in accelerated weathering tests because pvc is not as strong as other materials some pvc frames are reinforced with metal or composite materials to improve their structural strength
* modern aluminium window frames are typically separated by a thermal break made of a polyamide this greatly increases thermal resistance while retaining virtually all of the structural strength
composites may combine materials to obtain aesthetics of one material with the functional benefits of another
a special class of pvc window frames upvc window frames became widespread since the late 20th century particularly in europe there were 83.5 million installed by 1998 with numbers still growing as of 2012
low-emissivity coated panes reduce heat transfer by radiation which depending on which surface is coated helps prevent heat loss in cold climates or heat gains in warm climates
high thermal resistance can be obtained by evacuating or filling the insulated glazing units with gases such as argon or krypton which reduces conductive heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency
modern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window's u-factor its insulation value specifically its rate of heat loss in general soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient shgc than hard-coat low-e coatings
modern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by glazing bars or muntins due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass today glazing bars tend to be decorative separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use glazing bars are typically wooden but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns
many windows have movable window coverings such as blinds or curtains to keep out light provide additional insulation or ensure privacy windows allow natural light to enter but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain additionally while windows let the user see outside there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside window coverings are practical accommodations for these issues
historically windows are designed with surfaces parallel to vertical building walls such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles in passive solar building design an extended eave is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the windows
an alternative method is to calculate an optimum window mounting angle that accounts for summer sun load minimization with consideration of actual latitude of the building this process has been implemented for example in the dakin building in brisbane california—in which most of the fenestration is designed to reflect summer heat load and help prevent summer interior over-illumination and glare by canting windows to nearly a 45 degree angle
photovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building in most cases translucent photovoltaic cells are used
passive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss properly positioning these windows in relation to sun wind and landscape—while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons and providing thermal mass to absorb energy during the day and release it when temperatures cool at night—increases comfort and energy efficiency properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain these can even be a building's primary heating system
a window covering is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions for example some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare there are external shading devices and internal shading devices low-e window film is a low-cost alternative to window replacement to transform existing poorly-insulating windows into energy-efficient windows for high-rise buildings smart glass can provide an alternative
