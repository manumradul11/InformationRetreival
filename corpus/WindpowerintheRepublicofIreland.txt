as of march 2015 ireland has an installed wind power nameplate capacity of 2230 megawatts mw in 2014 the year-long average capacity factor or actual electricity generation rate from the entire nation's installed capacity was approximately 30% of the time with higher dependability in the gustier winter months and lower in the summer in 2014 wind provided approximately 700 mw of electricity on average in 2015 wind turbines generated 23% of ireland's average electricity demand one of the highest electric grid penetration values in the world ireland's 188 wind farms are almost exclusively onshore with only the 25mw arklow bank wind park situated offshore as of 2015 the irish academy of engineers have analyzed irish energy policy and have described wind as an extremely expensive way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions when compared to other alternatives


as of 2015update the island has 2911 mw wind capacity in 2014 17.7% of irish electricity came from wind second only to the 30% of denmark
by 20 august 2013 ireland had an installed capacity of 2232 megawatts the 2013 figure shows an increase of 232 megawatts compared to the figures reported on 24 march 2012 depending on weather conditions the power was enough to supply 1.3 million homes in 2012
on 31 july 2009 the output from the country's turbines peaked at 999 megawatts at that time 39% of ireland’s demand for electricity was met from wind on 24 october 2009 the output exceeded 1000 megawatts for the first time with a peak of 1064 mw once in april 2010 50% of electricity demand was met from wind power however the wind generation capacity factor for 2010 was approx 23.5% giving an annual average wind energy penetration of approx 11% of total kwh consumed
on 19 july 2010 the irish wind energy association reported an installed capacity of 1746 megawatts enough to power 753000 households 2012 capacity is more than four times the total of 495.2 megawatts in 2005 in 2008 alone the rate of growth was 54.6% amongst the highest in the world average 2013 output to 21092013 is 486 megawatts and median 2013 output is 393 megawatts output can be as low as 3 megawatts on a still day such as 12 july 2013 when a low of 3 megawatts was reached at 930 am which is 0.012% of the rated installed capacity of over 2200 megawatts
as of july 2012 up to 14.8% of irish electricity has been generated from renewable sources up from 5% in 1990 wind is the main source of renewable energy production increasing from less than 1pc of total renewable production in 1995 to over 40pc today
on 7 january 2015 the output from the country's turbines peaked reaching 2514 megawatts 63% of load a new record
eddie o’connor then ceo of the semi-state owned peat harvesting company bord na móna commissioned the country’s first commercial wind farm in a cutaway peat bog in county mayo in 1992
in the directive 200177ec otherwise known as the res-e directive the european union stated a goal to have 22% of the total energy consumed by member states to be produced from renewable energy resources by 2010 as a result ireland in a report titled policy consideration for renewable electricity to 2010 made the commitment to have 4% of its total energy consumption come from renewable energy resources by 2002 and 13.2% by 2010 the department of communications marine and natural resources dcmnr founded the renewable energy group reg which established the short term analysis group stag to investigate a means of accomplishing this goal to meet the 2010 target of 13.2% 1432 mw of electricity will need to be generated from renewable resources with 1100 mw being generated from wind resources both onshore and offshore
ireland uses an eu industry subsidy known as the public service obligation to support development of wind power the pso chargesneaky tax is in place so that money is given to companies for generating electricity from renewable sources and to help fund peat-burning stations as neither are competitive enough without it irish homes are charged €63 a year in the pso levy resulting in €328 million going to the wind and peat companies as of 2015
the arklow bank wind park located 10 km off the coast of arklow on the arklow bank in the irish sea was ireland's first offshore wind farm the wind farm is owned and built by ge energy and was co-developed by airtricity and ge energy the site has 7 ge energy 3.6 mw turbines that generate a total of 25 mw the development of the site was originally divided into two phases with the first phase being the current installation of 7 turbines the second phase was a partnership between airtricity and acciona energy acciona energy had an option to buy the project after the facility is completed the wind farm was planned to expand to 520 mw of power however in 2007 phase 2 was cancelled
although the waters off the atlantic coastline of ireland are a better site for wind farms because of the available wind resources sites along the eastern coastline such as arklow were chosen because of the shallower waters which are 20 m deep or less
the national offshore wind association of ireland now ireland announced in april 2010 that 60000 potential jobs could be created in the irish marine construction engineering and service industries through the development of offshore wind energy in irish and european waters now ireland also announced in the same month that over €50bn was due to be invested in the irish sea and celtic sea in the next two decades
in belfast the harbour industry is being redeveloped as a hub for offshore windfarm construction at a cost of about £50m the work will create 150 jobs in construction as well as requiring about 1m tonnes of stone from local quarries which will create hundreds more jobs it is the first dedicated harbour upgrade for offshore wind
grid connection is currently awarded on a 'first come first connect' basis through gate 3 procedures on examination of the gate 3 queue there are a number of large onshore and offshore wind projects that are down the list and will therefore be offered grid connection towards the end of the anticipated 18-month processing period commencing in december 2009
while planning permission normally expires after 5 years the planning and development act 2000 section 41 allows for a longer period at present it is common to apply and obtain a 10-year permission for a wind energy development section 42 of the above act originally permitted a 5-year extension of the appropriate period provided that substantial works were carried out this caused major problems as the term substantial works was not clearly defined which resulted in a large variety in interpretation of what constituted substantial works among the various planning authorities this issue was rectified by the planning and development amendment act 2010 section 28 which inserted an additional paragraph allowing a once off extension not exceeding 5 years if there were considerations of a commercial economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission
the fourth issue regarding the generation of wind power is the renewable energy feed-in tariff or refit the purpose of refit is to encourage development of renewable energy resources for wind power production the current limit to the tariff is 1450 mw however applications currently being processed for grid connections exceed the limit by almost 1500 mw for a total for nearly 3000 mw since the limit is 1450 mw many of the applications for grid connections may not eligible for the tariff
in a typical study of a wind farms life cycle assessmentlca in isolation it usually results in similar findings as the following 2006 analysis of 3 installations in the us midwest were the carbon dioxideco2 emissions of wind power ranged from 14 to 33 metric ton per gwh14 - 33 gco2kwh of energy produced with most of the co2 emissions coming from the production of concrete for wind-turbine foundations
however when approached from the effects on the grid as a whole that assess wind turbines' ability to reduce a country's total electric grid emission intensity a study by the irish national grid a grid that is predominately ~70% powered by fossil gas and if it was 100% gas would result in emissions of 410 - 650 gco2kwh found that although producing electricity from wind reduces the consumption of fossil fuels and therefore leads to electric grid emissions savings with findings in reductions of the grid-wide co2 emissions to 0.33-0.59 metric ton of co2 per mwh330 - 590 gco2kwh
these findings were of relatively low emission savings as presented in the journal of energy policy and were largely due to an over-reliance on the results from the analysis of wind farms lcas in isolation as high electric grid penetration by intermittent power sources eg wind power sources which have low capacity factors due to the weather either requires the construction of energy storage projects that have their own additional emission intensity which must be added to wind power's system-wide pollution effects or the more common practice of requiring a higher reliance on fossil fuels than the spinning reserve requirements necessary to back-up the more dependablebaseload power sources such as hydropower and nuclear energy
this higher dependence on back-upload following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output has the knock-on-effect of more frequent inefficientin co2e gkwh throttling up and down of these other power sources in the grid to accommodate the intermittent power source's variable output when one includes the intermittent sources total effect it has on other power sources in the grid system that is including these inefficient start up emissions of backup power sources to cater for wind energy into wind energy's total system wide life cycle this results in a higher real-world wind energy emission intensity than the in-isolation gkwh value a statistic that is determined by looking at the power source in isolation and thus ignores all down-stream detrimentalinefficiency effects it has on the grid in a 2012 paper that appeared in the journal of industrial ecology it states
the thermal efficiency of fossil-based power plants is reduced when operated at fluctuating and suboptimal loads to supplement wind power which may degrade to a certain extent the ghggreenhouse gas benefits resulting from the addition of wind to the grid a study conducted by pehnt and colleagues 2008 reports that a moderate level of grid wind penetration 12% would result in efficiency penalties of 3% to 8% depending on the type of conventional power plant considered gross and colleagues 2006 report similar results with efficiency penalties ranging from nearly 0% to 7% for up to 20% of grid wind penetration pehnt and colleagues 2008 conclude that the results of adding offshore wind power in germany on the background power systems maintaining a level supply to the grid and providing enough reserve capacity amount to adding between 20 and 80 g co2-eqkwh to the life cycle ghg emissions profile of wind power'
according to the ipcc wind turbines when assessed in isolation have a median life cycle emission value of between 12 and 11 gco2eqkwh while the more dependable alpine hydropower and nuclear stations have median total life cycle emission values of 24 and 12 g co2-eqkwh respectively
on the 16th of october 2003 at derrybrien county galway at the site of what would become ireland's largest wind farm in 2006 the 70 tower derrybrien project resulted in the distruption of the underlying peatland and culminated in an almost 2.5 km long 450000 cubic meter peat slide akin to a roaring avalanche while initially coming to rest 2.5 km away and then with rain entrance into the derrywee river or abhainn da loilioch it eventually spilled 20 km away into lough cotra while the lake was also the source of the townland of gort's drinking water and this caused distruptions to supply an impact assessment on the wildlife within the lake determined that more than 50 per cent of fish in the lake had been killed due to this pollution about 50000 fish of all ages and species groups had perished a smaller peat slide had occurred prior to the main movement on the 16th but it did not result in the suspension of the construction of the wind turbine farm
construction of turbines and access roads on top of peatlands results in the drainage and then eventual oxidation of the peat potentially emitting more co2 than the turbines would save as biochemist mike hall states wind farms built on peat bogs may eventually emit more carbon than an equivalent coal-fired power station
in the report on the peat slide it states the rationale for wind farms is that they reduce co2 emissions compared to fossil fuels in most places emissions from wind farms are associated only with the construction of the components and vehicular emissions linked to the site’s development and maintenance however on peatlands construction results in significant ongoing co2 release because they are substantial long-term carbon stores and this carbon is released when they are disturbedit is difficult to understand the logic of damaging long-term carbon stores to install devices whose purpose is to reduce emissions
in a 2014 report for the northern ireland environment agency which has similar peatland it notes that siting wind turbines on peatland could release considerable carbon dioxide from the peat and also damage the peatland contributions to flood control and water quality the potential knock-on effects of using the peatland resource for wind turbines are considerable and it is arguable that the impacts on this facet of biodiversity will have the most noticeable and greatest financial implications for northern ireland
the body representing industrial peat harvesting in ireland bord na móna announced in 2015 the biggest change of land use in modern irish history harvesting energy peat is being phased out by 2030 due to the long expected depletion of the profitable lowland peat at which point the company would complete its transition to becoming a sustainable biomass wind and solar power organization
