wind power in the united states is a branch of the energy industry expanding quickly over the last several years as of the end of 2015 the capacity was nearly 75000 mw this capacity is exceeded only by china and the european union thus far wind power's largest growth in capacity was in 2012 when 11895 mw of wind power was installed representing 26.5% of new power capacity the us wind industry has had an average annual growth of 25.8% over the last 10 years beginning of 2005-end of 2014
for calendar year 2014 the electricity produced from wind power in the united states amounted to 181.79 terawatt-hours or 4.44% of all generated electrical energy sixteen states have installed over 1000 mw of wind capacity with michigan just breaking the mark in the 4th quarter of 2013 texas with 14098 mw of capacity had the most installed wind power capacity of any us state at the end of 2014 and also had more under construction than any other state currently has installed the alta wind energy center in california is the largest wind farm in the united states with a capacity of 1320 mw of power ge energy is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer
the development of wind power in the united states has been supported primarily through a production tax credit which pays producers on the amount of electricity produced on january 1 2013 the production tax credit was extended for another year
uncertainty about future tax benefits for wind power led some companies to relocate or close their production facilities after the expiration of the production tax credit ptc expired in 2013 in late 2015 authorities provided an extension of the ptc the extension phases out the credit over a period of five years this is expected to add $35 billion of investment for 19 gigawatts of wind power


the first municipal use of multiple wind-electric turbines in the usa may have been a five turbine system in pettibone north dakota in 1940 these were commercial wincharger units on guyed towers
in 1980 the world's first wind farm consisting of twenty 30 kw wind turbines was installed at crotched mountain in new hampshire
from 1974 through the mid-1980s the united states government worked with industry to advance the technology and enable large commercial wind turbines a series of nasa wind turbines were developed under a program to create a utility-scale wind turbine industry in the us with funding from the national science foundation and later the united states department of energy doe a total of 13 experimental wind turbines were put into operation in four major wind turbine designs this research and development program pioneered many of the multi-megawatt turbine technologies in use today including steel tube towers variable-speed generators composite blade materials partial-span pitch control as well as aerodynamic structural and acoustic engineering design capabilities
later in the 1980s california provided tax rebates for wind power these rebates funded the first major use of wind power for utility electricity these machines gathered in large wind parks such as at altamont pass would be considered small and un-economic by modern wind power development standards in 1985 half of the world's wind energy was generated at altamont pass by the end of 1986 about 6700 wind turbines mostly less than 100 kw had been installed at altamont at a cost of about $1 billion and generated about 550 million kwhyear
the us as of 2016 has nearly 75 gw of installed wind power capacity only china has more installed capacityas of 31 december 2015update the five states with the most wind capacity installed were
twelve states now have 10 percent or more of their generation coming from wind power most of these are in the central plains these states include north dakota south dakota minnesota iowa colorado kansas oklahoma texas maine vermont oregon and idaho
the top five states according to percentage of generation by wind in 2015 were
the ten largest wind farms in the united states are
the alta wind energy center in california is the country's largest wind farm at 1320 megawatt mw capacity it consists of 490 wind turbines manufactured by general electric and vestas in 2012 it surpassed the roscoe wind farm in texas 
a 2012 report by a clean energy consulting group concluded that new wind farms can produce electricity in the 5-8 cents per kwh range making wind power cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many areas as of 2013 the us energy information administration estimates the levelized cost of wind energy from new installations as 7 to 10 cents per kwh depending on the geographic area but cautioned that levelized costs of non-dispatchable sources such as wind should be compared to the avoided energy cost rather than the levelized cost of dispatchable sources such as fossil fuels or geothermal in 2015 utah state university found that the true cost of wind energy is higher than most cost estimates calculate renewable portfolio standards require intermittent renewable energy to exist but at the expense of utilities and consumers the production tax credit makes wind power cheaper for utilities and consumers but at the expense of taxpayers
wind power has increased dramatically over the past few years in 2010 however newly installed generating capacity was about half of the previous year due to various factors including the financial crisis and recession in 2013 there was a 92% reduction in newly installed generating capacity compared to 2012 due to the late extension of the ptc  the graph at left shows the growth in installed wind generation capacity in the united states based on data from the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy in 2008 installed capacity in the us increased by 50% over the prior year the world average growth rate that year was 28.8%
as of 2014 the wind industry in the usa is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades capturing the faster winds at higher elevations this has opened up new opportunities and in indiana michigan and ohio the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio saying it is their cheapest option
the capacity factor is the ratio of power actually produced divided by the nameplate capacity of the turbines the overall average capacity factor for wind generation in the us increased from 31.7% in 2008 to 32.3% in 2013
according to the national renewable energy laboratory the contiguous united states has the potential for 10459 gw of onshore wind power the capacity could generate 37 petawatt-hours pw·h annually an amount nine times larger than current total us electricity consumption the us also has large wind resources in alaska and hawaii
in addition to the large onshore wind resources the us has large offshore wind power potential with another nrel report released in september 2010 showing that the us has 4150 gw of potential offshore wind power nameplate capacity an amount 4 times that of the country's 2008 installed capacity from all sources of 1010 gw
the us department of energy’s 2008 report 20% wind energy by 2030 envisioned that wind power could supply 20% of all us electricity which included a contribution of 4% to the nation’s total electricity from offshore wind power in order to achieve this however significant advances in cost performance and reliability are needed based on a 2011 report from a coalition of researchers from universities industry and government supported by the atkinson center for a sustainable future obtaining 20% from wind requires about 305 gw of wind turbines an increase of 16 gwyear after 2018 or an average increase of 14.6%year and transmission line improvements analysts estimate 25 gw of added us wind power in 2016-18
in 2015 electricity generation from wind power was 10 percent or more in twelve us states colorado idaho iowa kansas maine minnesota north dakota oklahoma oregon and south dakota vermont and texas iowa south dakota and kansas each had more than 20 percent of their electricity generation come from wind twenty states now have more than five percent of their generation coming from wind
in 2010 texas surpassed the 10000 mw mark with the addition of over 600 mw of generating capacity texas has many wind farms which together total an installed capacity of 14098 mw at the end of 2014 texas had over 7500 mw under construction the roscoe wind farm in roscoe texas texas's largest wind farm with 627 wind turbines and a total installed capacity of 781.5 mw surpassed the nearby 735.5 mw horse hollow wind energy center it is located about 200 miles 320 km west of fort worth and the wind farm area spans parts of four texas counties
wind power in california has doubled in capacity since 2002 with a total of nearly 4000 megawatts installed as of the end of 2011 wind energy now supplies about 5% of california’s total electricity needs or enough to power more than 400000 householdscitation needed in 2011 921.3 megawatts were installed most of that activity occurred in the tehachapi area of kern county with some big projects in solano contra costa and riverside counties as wellcitation needed after 2014 california now ranks second nationwide in terms of capacity behind texas with a capacity of 5917 mw
large portions of california's wind output are located in three primary regions altamont pass wind farm east of san francisco tehachapi pass wind farm south east of bakersfield and san gorgonio pass wind farm near palm springs east of los angeles the giant new alta wind energy center is also located within the tehachapi pass region
more than 30 percent of the electricity generated in iowa now comes from wind power iowa had 5688 megawatts mw of generation capacity at the end of 2014 third only to texas and california electrical energy generated in iowa by wind in 2014 amounted to over 16 million megawatt-hours since iowa adopted a renewable energy standard in 1983 the wind power industry has generated almost $5 billion in investment the second concrete wind turbine tower to be built in the us and also the country's tallest 377 feet at the time built is in adams county completion is expected early spring of 2016
oklahoma has one of the best resources in the united states bergey windpower a leading manufacturer of small wind turbines is located in oklahoma programs leading to careers in the wind power industry are provided at tech schools community colleges and universities in oklahoma the oklahoma wind power initiative supports the development of wind power in the state
wind power has been supported by a renewable portfolio standard passed in 2007 and strengthened in 2009 which requires 10% renewable energy from electric companies by 2010 and 25% by 2025 illinois has the potential for installing up to an estimated 249882 mw of wind generation capacity at a hub height of 80 meters
in 2012 kansas saw a large number of wind projects completed making it among the largest and fastest growing wind energy marketscitation needed at the end of 2014 the total capacity sits at 2967 mw kansas has high potential capacity for wind power second behind texas the most recent estimates are that kansas has a potential for 950 gw of wind power capacity kansas could generate 3900 tw·h of electricity each year which represents more than all the electricity generated from coal natural gas and nuclear combined in the united states in 2011
the average price of power purchase agreements was $23.5mwh in 2014 operating expenses were estimated to $10mwh
since 2005 many turbine manufacturing leaders have opened us facilities of the top 10 global manufacturers in 2007 seven – vestas ge energy gamesa suzlon siemens acciona and nordex – have an american manufacturing presence repower is another manufacturer with notable usage in the united states
plans for 30 new manufacturing facilities were announced in 2008 and the wind industry expects to see a continued shift towards domestic manufacturing in the coming years in total 70 manufacturing facilities have begun production been expanded or announced since january 2007
as of april 2009 over 100 companies are producing components for wind turbines employing thousands of workers in the manufacture of parts as varied as towers composite blades bearings and gears many existing companies in traditional manufacturing states have retooled to enter the wind industry their manufacturing facilities are spread across 40 states employing workers from the southeast to the steel belt to the great plains and on to the pacific northwest
the us department of energy doe is working with six leading wind turbine manufacturers towards achieving 20% wind power in the united states by 2030 the doe announced the memorandum of understanding mou with ge energy siemens power generation vestas wind systems clipper windpower suzlon energy and gamesa corporation under the mou the doe and the six manufacturers will collaborate to gather and exchange information relating to five major areas research and development related to turbine reliability and operability siting strategies for wind power facilities standards development for turbine certification and universal interconnection of wind turbines manufacturing advances in design process automation and fabrication techniques and workforce development
in 2014 ge had 60% siemens had 26% and vestas had 12% of us market share combined they had 98% most new turbines were designed for low wind the turbine manufacturers compete with each other and cause decreasing turbine prices
the doe's national renewable energy laboratory nrel has announced a number of wind technology projects including a new state-of-the-art wind turbine blade test facility to be built in ingleside texas the texas-nrel large blade research and test facility will be capable of testing blades as long as 70 meters 230 feet it will be built and operated through a partnership among nrel doe and a state consortium led by university of houston with the university owning and operating the facility's buildings doe funding up to $2 million in capital costs and nrel providing technical and operational assistance the blade test facility is estimated to cost between $12 million and $15 million and should be completed by 2010 located on the gulf coast the texas facility will complement a similar facility that is being built on the coast of massachusetts
nrel has also recently signed agreements with siemens power generation and first wind a wind power developer siemens is launching a new research and development facility in nearby boulder colorado and has agreed to locate and test a commercial-scale wind turbine at nrel's national wind technology center nwtc first wind formerly called upc wind partners llc owns and operates the 30-megawatt kaheawa wind power farm in west maui hawaii and has agreed to let the nwtc establish a remote research affiliate partner site at the facility the maui satellite of nwtc will collaborate with first wind on studies to develop advanced wind energy technologies including energy storage and integration of renewable electricity into maui's electrical grid
in july 2008 texas approved a $4.93 billion expansion of the state's electric grid to bring wind energy to its major cities transmission companies will recoup the cost of constructing the new power lines expected to be completed in 2013 from fees estimated at $4 per month for residential customers this lack of capacity forced wind turbines to be shut down at times and reduced wind power generation in texas by 17% in 2009
in 2010 the doe awarded $60 million for a study of transmission requirements beginning in 2006 the doe is required to provide a transmission congestion report once every three years
recent us policy has generally been to provide an inflation-adjusted federal production tax credit ptc of $15 per mw·h in 1995 dollars generated for the first ten years of operation for wind energy sold as of 2015 the credit was $23 per mw·h renewable portfolio standards mandating a certain percentage of electricity sales come from renewable energy sources which are in place in about half of the states also have boosted the development of the wind industry
each time congress has allowed the production tax credit has expired wind power development has slowed as investors wait for the credit to be restored each year it is renewed development has expanded the tax credit expired at the end of 2012 bringing wind power development activity to a near halt a short term one year policy was enacted at the beginning of 2013 which provides a tax credit to projects under construction by the end of 2013 and completed before the end of 2014{cn} the ptc was first introduced in 1992 when it was allowed to expire development dropped 93% 73% and 77% the following year
the energy information administration has reported that wind power received the largest share of direct federal subsidies and support in fiscal year 2013 the latest year for which statistics are available accounting for 37% $5.936 billion of total electricity-related subsidies almost three-quarters of wind energy subsidies in that year were direct expenditures and largely resulted from the arra programs these figures do not include subsidies and supports from other levels of government
there is competition for wind farms among farmers in places like iowa or ranchers in colorado farmers with no investment on their part typically receive $3000–5000 per year in royalties from the local utility for siting a single large advanced-design wind turbine
landscape and ecological issues may be significant for some wind farm proposals and environmental issues are a consideration in site selection
worldwide experience has shown that community consultation and direct involvement of the general public in wind farm projects has helped to increase community approval and some wind farms overseas have become tourist attractions
as of 2014update the united states still had no operational offshore wind power facilities development is hindered by relatively high cost compared to onshore facilities several projects are under development with some at advanced stages of development the united states though has very large offshore wind energy resources due to strong consistent winds off the long us coastline
the 2011 nrel report large-scale offshore wind power in the united states analyzes the current state of the offshore wind energy industry according to the report offshore wind resource development would help the country to achieve 20% of its electricity from wind by 2030 and to revitalize the manufacturing sector offshore wind could supply 54 gigawatts of capacity to the nation's electrical grid thereby increasing energy security it could also generate an estimated $200 billion in new economic activity and create thousands of permanent jobs nrel’s report concludes that the development of the nation’s offshore wind resources can provide many potential benefits and with effective research policies and commitment offshore wind energy can play a vital role in future us energy markets
coastal residents have opposed offshore wind farms because of fears about impacts on marine life the environment electricity rates aesthetics and recreation such as fishing and boating however residents also cite improved electricity rates air quality and job creation as positive impacts they would expect from wind farms because the bases of offshore turbines function as artificial reefs studies have shown that after the initial disturbance of construction local fish and shellfish are positively affected because wind turbines can be positioned at some distance from shore impacts to recreation and fishing can be managed by careful planning of wind farm locations
five exploratory leases for wind power production on the outer continental shelf offshore from new jersey and delaware were issued in june 2009 by the secretary of the interior the leases authorize data gathering activities allowing for the construction of meteorological towers on the outer continental shelf from six to 18 miles 29 km offshore four areas are being considered on february 7 2011 salazar and stephen chu announced a national strategy to have offshore wind power of 10 gw in 2020 and 54 gw in 2030
projects are under development in areas of the east coast great lakes and gulf coast
rhode island and massachusetts state officials picked deepwater wind to build a $1.5-billion 385-megawatt wind farm in federal waters off block island the 100-turbine project could provide 1.3 terawatt-hours tw·h of electricity per year – 15 percent of all electricity used in the state of rhode island in 2009 deepwater signed an agreement with national grid to sell the power from a $200-million 30-mw wind farm off block island at an initial price of 24.4 ¢kw·h construction of the block island wind farm a five turbine project began in april 2015
the cape wind project is a proposed offshore wind farm on horseshoe shoal in nantucket sound off cape cod in the us state of massachusetts the 468 mw wind farm was proposed by a private developer cape wind associates the project has been fought by the alliance to protect nantucket sound formed in 2001 to oppose the proposal 
the project was expected to cost $2.5 billionas a comparison the cost mid american energy's 2014-2015 expansion of projects in iowa totaling 1050 mw capacity was stated to be $1.9 billion the expected capacity factors of the two expansions projects are very similar 38% versus 36% in this case often cited improved capacity factors for offshore wind are virtually non-existentcitation needed
to promote wind power in new jersey in 2007 the state awarded a $4.4 million contract to conduct an 18-month oceanwind power ecological baseline study becoming the first state to sponsor an ocean and wind power study before allowing renewable energy developers to study and build off its shores the study focused on a designated area off the coast to determine the current distribution abundance and migratory patterns of avian species fish marine resources and sea turtle use of the existing ecological resourcesthe results of the study were released in june 2010 the study concluded that the effects of developing offshore windfarms would be negligible
in 2008 new federal rules greatly expanded the territory offshore wind parks can be built previously projects were only allowed in shallow state waters within 3 nautical miles 5.6 km of shore the edge of us territory is about 200 nautical miles 370 km out increased distance from the coast diminishes their visibility waters off the coast of the united states are deeper than in europe requiring different designs
atlantic wind connection is a proposed electrical transmission backbone to be built off the atlantic coast of the united states to serve off-shore wind farms the transmission line proposed by trans-elect development company would deliver power ashore in southern virginia delaware southern new jersey and northern new jersey as a first of its kind project it poses significant risks of encountering unexpected technological challenges and cost overruns such an offshore backbone is an element in the national electricity strategy
bechtel has been selected as the epc contractor and alstom as technical advisor for the first phase of the development for the project google and good energies an investment firm are the major investors in the $5 billion project
winds in the central plains region of the us are variable on both short minutes and long days time scales variations in wind speed result in variations in power output from wind farms which poses difficulties incorporating wind power into an integrated power system wind turbines are driven by boundary layer winds those that occur near the surface of the earth at around 300 feet boundary layer winds are controlled by wind in the higher free atmosphere and have turbulence due to interaction with surface features such as trees hills and buildings short term or high frequency variations are due to this turbulence in the boundary layer
long term variations are due to the passage of transient waves in the atmosphere with a characteristic time scale of several days the transient waves that influence wind in the central us are large scale and this results in the power output from wind farms in the region being somewhat correlated and not entirely independent large scale distribution of wind farms significantly reduce short term variability limiting the relative standard deviation of the capacity factor to about 45% the correlation is highest in summer and lowest in winter
the us federal government has jurisdiction to prevent bird and bat deaths by wind turbines under the endangered species act the migratory bird treaty act and the bald and golden eagle protection act under the 2009 bald and golden eagle protection act the interior department could issue permits to allow non-purposeful take for activities where eagle deaths were considered unavoidable however as of december 2013 no take permits had been issued to wind energy developers
the united states fish and wildlife service has published voluntary guidelines for design and siting of wind turbines to minimize bird and bat deaths interim guidelines were published in 2003 and the latest version in 2012 the document recognizes that even the best management practices may not prevent wind turbine bird deaths in violation of federal law but stated however if a violation occurs the service will consider a developer’s documented efforts to communicate with the service and adhere to the guidelines
in 2013 the obama administration was accused of having a double standard to protect the wind industry from bald and golden eagle protection act prosecutions while vigorously pursuing violations by oil companies and owners of power lines the administration refused to divulge the number of raptor deaths reported to it by wind companies saying that to do so would reveal trade secrets the government also ordered federal law enforcement field agents not to pursue bird-death prosecutions against wind companies without prior approval from washington the policy was said to be an environmental trade-off to promote renewable energy
in november 2013 the federal government obtained its first criminal conviction of a wind power operator for killing protected birds in violation of the 1918 migratory bird treaty act duke energy plead guilty and was fined $1 million for the deaths of 160 birds including 14 golden eagles at two wind farms in wyoming the justice department charged that duke had designed and sited the turbines knowing that they would kill birds duke noted that it had self-reported the bird deaths and that us fish and wildlife service guidelines for reducing bird deaths by wind turbines had not been issued when the turbines were built after they were charged duke implemented a radar detection system at a cost of $600000 per year designed to turn off turbines when approached by large birds the company noted that the system was working as no golden eagle deaths had been observed in more than a year of operation since the radar was installed
in december 2013 the us fish and wildlife service announced that it would issue 30-year permits to wind energy projects to allow for eagle deaths previously permits had been available for only 5 years but none were issued to wind projects under the 30-year permits wind power developers would be required to report eagle deaths and the permits would be reviewed every 5 years the measure was intended to remove what was seen as legal uncertainty discouraging wind energy investments the government said that an environmental review was not needed for the change because it was only an administrative change the new regulation was welcomed by the american wind energy association which said that wind power caused less than two percent of human-caused eagle fatalities and pointed out that the rules would require extensive mitigation and monitoring of eagle deaths the extension of eagle taking permits from 5 to 30 years was opposed by a number of conservation groups including the american bird conservancy the nature conservancy the sierra club the audubon society and the humane society of the united states
